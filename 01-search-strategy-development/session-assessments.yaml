      v2: Refined from v1 based on preview assessment. Changes: (1) Removed
      standalone "feedback", "scoring", "grading" from concept-wba (caused massive
      noise from exam scoring, application grading, general feedback studies),
      replaced with compound terms "assessment feedback", "assessment scoring". (2)
      Removed "clinical performance" (too broad, captured AI performance in clinical
      tasks rather than assessment of clinical performance). (3) Removed "clinical
      assessment*" (ambiguous, captured clinician assessments of patients rather
      than assessment of clinical skills). (4) Added "clinical evaluation*" and
      "competence assessment*" as more specific terms. (5) Kept all WBA-specific
      terms intact for recall. (6) Refined arXiv replacements to match. Concept
      structure unchanged: 3 blocks AND'd.

However, substantial noise from: (1) LLM exam-taking benchmarks (~30% of noise), (2) MCQ generation studies, (3) OSCE studies, (4) Athletic training articles matching EPA acronym (16 from ERIC). The broad terms 'clinical competenc*', 'formative assessment*', 'performance assessment*' capture many irrelevant articles about AI demonstrating competence on exams rather than AI being used to assess clinical competence. Consider: removing 'clinical competenc*' and replacing with more specific WBA terms; adding 'assess* of' compound phrases; the noise level is manageable for AI screening but could be reduced further."

      v3: Refined from v2 based on results assessment (~15-25% precision, 764
      unique). Changes to concept-wba: (1) Removed broad terms that captured
      AI-competency and exam-taking noise: "clinical competenc*" (matched
      AI-demonstrating-competence articles), "formative assessment*" (too broad),
      "performance assessment*" (matched AI performance benchmarks), "clinical
      evaluation*" (ambiguous), "clinical supervision" (too broad), "competence
      assessment*" (too broad). (2) Added specific WBA terms: "competency-based
      assessment*" (replaces clinical competenc*), "programmatic assessment"
      (CBME-specific), "EPAs" (plural, more specific to medical education). (3) Kept
      all WBA tool names, feedback compound terms, clinical records terms. Concepts
      1-2 unchanged.

      because ERIC's Lucene API parses hyphens as boolean NOT (e.g., 'o1-preview'
      becomes 'o1 NOT preview'). Moreover, these terms added 0 new captures in
      PubMed, Scopus, and arXiv — articles discussing o1/o3 models are already
      captured by broader terms ('large language model*', 'LLM', 'generative AI').
      (3) LOW-MEDIUM: 'Grok' was tested but EXCLUDED — caused an additional ~146
      false positives in ERIC because the API matches case-insensitively and 'grok'
      is an informal English verb meaning 'to understand' used in education
      literature. The 5 legitimate Grok-model articles in the result set are already

          Refinement needed before finalizing. Two issues to investigate:
          (1) Short/ambiguous terms lowering precision without improving recall:
          Terms like 'LLM', 'EPA', 'DOPS', 'WBA', 'CBME' are common abbreviations
          that may match unrelated fields (e.g., 'EPA' = Environmental Protection Agency,
          'LLM' = Master of Laws, 'DOPS' = unrelated acronyms). These short terms
          likely contribute to false positives and lower precision without meaningfully
          increasing recall, since relevant articles typically also contain the
          corresponding full-form terms already in the query. Need to empirically test
          the incremental recall contribution of each short abbreviation vs. the
          precision cost (run searches with/without these terms and compare).
          (2) ChatGPT/OpenAI model coverage: Check the OpenAI models page
          (https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models) to verify whether major
          recent models are adequately covered in concept-genai. Current query includes
          GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4V, GPT-5, but newer models (e.g., o1, o3,
          o3-mini, o4-mini, GPT-4.1 series) may appear in recent literature and should
          be evaluated for inclusion. The earlier exclusion of o1-preview/o1-mini due to
          ERIC hyphen parsing issues should be revisited with alternative syntax or
          provider-specific replacements.

      v7: Refined from v6 based on human reviewer (TK) assessment of session
      20260212_genaiwbav6_a75094. Two changes: (1) Removed short/ambiguous
      abbreviations that risk lowering precision without improving recall:
      'LLM'/'LLMs' from concept-genai (full form 'large language model*' already
      covers), 'EPA'/'EPAs' from concept-wba (full form 'entrustable professional

      (full forms 'workplace-based assessment*' etc. already cover), 'CBME' from

      These abbreviations are common in unrelated fields (EPA=Environmental
      Protection Agency, LLM=Master of Laws, DOPS/WBA/CBME=various unrelated
      acronyms). The empirical impact on recall will be verified by diff against v6.
      (2) Added 'GPT-4.1' and 'GPT-4.5' to concept-genai to cover newer OpenAI
      models released in 2025. o-series models (o1, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini) were NOT
      added: 'o1'/'o3' are too short and ambiguous (2 chars, match blood types,
      ozone, etc.), hyphenated forms cause ERIC false positives (as documented in

      GPT-5.x models (5.1, 5.2, 5.3) were not added as they were released too
      recently (Nov-Dec 2025) for articles to have been published and indexed.

      20260212_genaiwbav6_a75094. Three changes: (1) Removed short/ambiguous
      abbreviations that risk lowering precision without improving recall:
      'LLM'/'LLMs' from concept-genai (full form 'large language model*' already
      covers), 'EPA'/'EPAs' from concept-wba (full form 'entrustable professional

      These abbreviations are common in unrelated fields (EPA=Environmental
      Protection Agency, LLM=Master of Laws, DOPS/WBA/CBME=various unrelated
      acronyms). Empirical testing confirmed: only 3 articles removed vs v6, of
      which 2 were false positives (environmental science article matched by 'EPA',
      2022 non-GenAI article matched by 'EPA'), and 1 was a commentary that would be
      excluded during screening. Validation recall unchanged at 2/2 (100%). (2)
      Added 'GPT-4.1' and 'GPT-4.5' to concept-genai for PubMed, Scopus, and arXiv
      to cover newer OpenAI models released in 2025. These terms are EXCLUDED from
      the ERIC replacement block because ERIC's Lucene parser mishandles the period
      in 'GPT-4.1'/'GPT-4.5', parsing 'description:GPT-4.1' as 'description:GPT AND
      NOT 4.1', which broadly matches any article mentioning 'GPT' and caused +127
      false positives in initial testing (20260213_genaiwbav7_e79f94). (3) Added
      ERIC-specific replacement for concept-genai to exclude GPT-4.1/GPT-4.5 and
      'LLM'/'LLMs' (already excluded from default block). o-series models (o1, o3,
      o3-mini, o4-mini) were NOT added to any provider: 'o1'/'o3' are too short and
      ambiguous (2 chars, match blood types, ozone, etc.), hyphenated forms cause
      ERIC false positives (documented in v6), and v5 testing confirmed 0
      incremental captures from o-series in PubMed/Scopus/arXiv since articles

GPT-5.x (5.1-5.3) not added: released Nov-Dec 2025, too recent for indexed literature. (3) ERIC Lucene fix: Initial v7 testing revealed GPT-4.1/4.5 caused +127 ERIC false positives because ERIC's Lucene parser splits periods (description:GPT-4.1 → description:GPT AND NOT 4.1).

Addition of GPT-4.1/GPT-4.5 appropriately extends model coverage. ERIC-specific replacement correctly prevents Lucene parsing artifacts.

          Forward citation tracking on seed articles (Kwan 2025, Burke 2024) from
          khan2025-validation-set identified 2 potentially in-scope papers NOT
          captured by this search session:
          (1) Bany Abdelnabi et al. 2025 (10.1145/3712298) — LLMs for H&P feedback
              during clerkship. Published in ACM Transactions on Computing for
              Healthcare.
          (2) Jamieson et al. 2024 (10.1056/aics2400631) — Rubrics to Prompts:
              assessing post-encounter notes with AI. Published in NEJM AI.
          Both journals are likely indexed in Scopus but were not captured. Possible
          causes to investigate:
          - Journal coverage gap: ACM Trans and NEJM AI may not be fully indexed in
            searched databases at time of search.
          - Search term gap: these papers may use terminology not covered by current
            concept blocks (e.g., "H&P", "history and physical", "post-encounter
            note", "clinical documentation" without explicit WBA/assessment terms).
          - Concept-wba block may be too narrow for clinical documentation/note
            assessment tasks that do not use standard WBA terminology.
          ACTION: Before finalizing search, verify whether these papers are indexed
          in Scopus and if so, identify which query terms would have captured them.
          Consider adding "clinical note*" or "clinical documentation" to
          concept-wba if gap is confirmed. Any query modification requires re-run
          and diff review per protocol.

Term gap analysis: tested adding 'post-encounter note*', 'history and physical', 'clinical documentation' to concept-wba. 33 hits across PubMed+Scopus, but spot-checking confirms most are already captured by v7 through existing terms. Adding these broad terms risks noise without meaningful recall improvement for WBA-specific literature. CONCLUSION: Both gaps are DATABASE COVERAGE gaps (journals not indexed), not search term gaps. No query modification warranted. Papers should enter review via PRISMA 'Identification via other methods' pathway as already planned in forward-citations action items."

          Post-search co-author review by Yuki Kataoka (YK). YK independently
          audited the v7 search strategy and proposed optimizations in three areas:
          (1) Block 1 (concept-genai): Consolidate individual GPT model name terms
          (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, GPT4, GPT-4V, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, GPT-5) into
          a single wildcard GPT*[tiab] plus GPT4[tiab]; consolidate LLaMA/"Llama 2"/
          "Llama 3" into llama[tiab]. MeSH analysis confirmed "Generative Artificial
          Intelligence"[mh] and Chatbot[mh] are identical sets (1,518 articles);
          both retained for future MeSH tree divergence.
          (2) Block 2 (concept-meded): Remove 3 redundant child MeSH terms
          ("Education, Medical, Graduate/Undergraduate/Continuing") already subsumed
          by parent "Education, Medical"[mh]. Add 4 free-text keywords: clerkship*,
          "clinical rotation*", "clinical supervisor*", "medical curriculum".
          (3) Block 3 (concept-wba): No term changes; confirmed validity of 4 MeSH
          terms (Clinical Competence, Educational Measurement, Competency-Based
          Education, Formative Feedback).
          YK reported: 78→71 terms, PubMed 470→473 hits, both seed articles
          captured. Full report: co-author-review/20260216-01-search-strategy/

          Empirical verification of YK's proposed changes (v8 test session:
          20260215_genaiwbav8_601278). Ran v8 query and compared with v7 session
          using search-hub diff. Also ran v7 count-only today to control for
          temporal indexing drift.

          TEMPORAL CONTROL: v7 re-run today yields PubMed 470 (unchanged),
          Scopus 90 (+1 from 89), ERIC 181, arXiv 4. Confirms PubMed is stable;
          Scopus has +1 article from new indexing since 2026-02-13.

          OVERALL DIFF (v7 session → v8 session): Common 706, Added 6, Removed 0.
          Breakdown: PubMed +3 (query change), Scopus +3 (1 temporal + 2 query),
          ERIC 0, arXiv 0. Total deduped: 706→712.

          BLOCK 2 KEYWORD ISOLATION TEST: Created v7+B2keywords variant (v7 Block 1
          unchanged, Block 2 keywords added; test session:
          20260216_genaiwbav7b2test_3ac1c0). Result: PubMed 470 (no change),
          Scopus 91 (+1 vs v7 today). Conclusion: Block 2 free keyword additions
          have zero effect on PubMed and marginal effect on Scopus (+1). The
          PubMed +3 is entirely attributable to Block 1 GPT* wildcard change.

          BLOCK 2 KEYWORD — SCOPUS ADDED ARTICLES: Diff of v7 session vs
          v7+B2keywords session shows 2 Scopus articles added (89→91). Of these,
          ~1 is temporal (new Scopus indexing since 2026-02-13) and ~1 is from
          keyword additions (based on count-only analysis: v7 today = 90,
          v7+B2keywords = 91). Both articles are out-of-scope:
          (a) Carson & Sobolewski 2026 (10.1016/j.pedhc.2025.12.009) — "Evidence-
              Based Guidelines for Podcast Production and Use in Competency-Based
              Health Professions Education". J Pediatric Health Care. Podcast
              education guidelines; AI mentioned only peripherally in one sentence.
          (b) Durongphan 2025 (10.33192/smj.v77i12.275193) — "From Cadaveric
              Dissection to Artificial Intelligence: A Chronological Review of
              Advances in Anatomy Education". Siriraj Medical Journal. Historical
              review of anatomy teaching methods; AI as one of many educational
              technologies, not GenAI-specific.
          CONCLUSION: Block 2 free keyword additions (clerkship*, "clinical
          rotation*", "clinical supervisor*", "medical curriculum") contribute no
          in-scope articles across any database. Existing Block 2 terms and MeSH
          already provide sufficient coverage for the medical education concept.

          ANALYSIS OF 6 ADDED ARTICLES:
          (1) Aiyar & Moon 2025 (PMID 41584948, PubMed) — "evidence-based GPT
              model to improve medical student understanding of PFTs". Captured by
              GPT*[tiab] matching "GPT model"/"GPT tool". GenAI education tool but
              not WBA-related; likely excluded at screening.
          (2) Aurello et al. 2025 (PMID 40454799, PubMed) — "Enhancing Surgical
              Education Through AI in the Era of Digital Surgery". VR/AR-focused
              review with no GenAI/LLM content in abstract. Capture mechanism
              unclear; may involve PubMed metadata not visible in abstract.
              Out-of-scope (no generative AI).
          (3) Alele et al. 2024 (PMID 39075437, PubMed) — "perceived relevance,
              utility and retention of basic sciences in general practice". FALSE
              POSITIVE: GPT*[tiab] matches "GPT" = "General Practice Training"
              abbreviation in abstract. No GenAI content whatsoever.
          (4) Carson & Sobolewski 2026 (Scopus) — "Guidelines for Podcast
              Production in Competency-Based HPE". Mentions AI peripherally.
              Out-of-scope.
          (5) Durongphan 2025 (Scopus) — "From Cadaveric Dissection to AI:
              Advances in Anatomy Education". Anatomy education history review.
              Out-of-scope.
          (6) Fisher et al. 2023 (Scopus) — "Exam prediction and the GPR-CAG".
              No GenAI content. Likely false positive or temporal addition.

          KEY FINDING — GPT* WILDCARD PRECISION RISK: The consolidation of
          individual GPT model names into GPT*[tiab] introduces false positives
          from the medical education abbreviation "GPT" (General Practice Training),
          which is prevalent in GP/family medicine literature. Of the 3 PubMed
          additions, 1 is a clear false positive from this collision, 1 has an
          unclear capture mechanism, and only 1 is a genuine GenAI article (though
          still out-of-scope for WBA). The v7 approach of enumerating specific
          model names (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.) avoids this issue while maintaining
          equivalent recall for actual GenAI literature.

          DECISION PENDING: Whether to adopt v8 changes requires weighing the
          marginal future-proofing benefit of GPT* against the precision cost.
          Since screening has already begun on v7 results, adopting v8 would
          require re-screening the 6 added articles. Block 2 keyword additions
          and child MeSH removal have negligible impact and could be adopted
          independently without affecting results.

      Single change: removed 3 redundant child MeSH terms from concept-meded

      'Education, Medical, Continuing'). These are already subsumed by the parent
