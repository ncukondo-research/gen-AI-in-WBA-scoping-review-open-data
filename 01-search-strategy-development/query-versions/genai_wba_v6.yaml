description: >
  v6: Refined from v5 based on PRESS 2015 review of session 20260212_genaiwbav5_5bfdca
  (AI reviewer 1, Claude Opus 4.6). Element 4 (Text Word Search) was Partially Adequate.
  Changes: (1) HIGH: Added 'DeepSeek' to concept-genai and arXiv replacement block —
  prominent in 2025 medical education literature, may not co-occur with generic LLM
  terms. Added 1 new PubMed hit and 15 new ERIC hits. (2) MEDIUM: 'o1-preview' and
  'o1-mini' were tested but EXCLUDED — the hyphenated terms caused ~131 false positives
  in ERIC because ERIC's Lucene API parses hyphens as boolean NOT (e.g., 'o1-preview'
  becomes 'o1 NOT preview'). Moreover, these terms added 0 new captures in PubMed,
  Scopus, and arXiv — articles discussing o1/o3 models are already captured by broader
  terms ('large language model*', 'LLM', 'generative AI'). (3) LOW-MEDIUM: 'Grok' was
  tested but EXCLUDED — caused an additional ~146 false positives in ERIC because the
  API matches case-insensitively and 'grok' is an informal English verb meaning 'to
  understand' used in education literature. The 5 legitimate Grok-model articles in the
  result set are already captured by broader terms. All other terms unchanged from v5.
