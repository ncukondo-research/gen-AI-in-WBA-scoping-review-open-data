  v8: Minor cleanup from v7 based on co-author review by Yuki Kataoka (YK).
  Single change: removed 3 redundant child MeSH terms from concept-meded
  ('Education, Medical, Graduate', 'Education, Medical, Undergraduate',
  'Education, Medical, Continuing'). These are already subsumed by the parent
  term 'Education, Medical'[mh] via PubMed's automatic MeSH explosion. YK's
  MeSH analysis confirmed this redundancy. Empirical verification confirmed
  zero impact on search results across all databases. Other YK proposals
  (Block 1 GPT* wildcard consolidation, Block 2 free keyword additions) were
  tested but NOT adopted: GPT* introduces false positives from 'General
  Practice Training' abbreviation in GP/family medicine literature; Block 2
  keyword additions (clerkship*, clinical rotation*, clinical supervisor*,
  medical curriculum) had zero PubMed impact and only added out-of-scope
  Scopus articles. See session 20260213_genaiwbav7_d5dcc5 notes for full
  verification details.
