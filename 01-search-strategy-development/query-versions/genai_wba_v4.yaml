description: >
  v4: Refined from v3 based on PRESS 2015 review of session 20260212_genaiwbav3_000d30.
  Changes: (1) Added 'Generative Artificial Intelligence'[mh] to concept-genai — new 2025
  MeSH descriptor (tree L01.224.050.375.308) was missing, significant gap for indexed article
  capture. (2) Added 'GPT-5' to concept-genai keywords — major 2025 model not covered.
  (3) Removed 'clinical competence' from arXiv provider concept-wba replacement — inconsistent
  with v3 rationale that removed broad 'clinical competenc*' from main query.
  (4) Added 'milestone*' to concept-wba keywords for ACGME/CanMEDS milestone assessments
  (evaluate noise impact via diff). All other terms unchanged from v3.
