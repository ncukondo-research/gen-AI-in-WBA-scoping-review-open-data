description: >
  v5: Refined from v4 based on PRESS 2015 review of session 20260212_genaiwbav4_8892e3.
  Changes: (1) Added 'Large Language Models'[mh] (D000098342) to concept-genai — new 2025
  MeSH descriptor directly relevant to core concept, missing from v4. Articles indexed with
  this heading but lacking free-text LLM terms in title/abstract may have been missed.
  (2) Added 'Chatbots'[mh] to concept-genai — ensures coverage regardless of whether
  'Generative Artificial Intelligence'[mh] explosion includes this term. All other terms
  unchanged from v4.
