description: >
  v3: Refined from v2 based on results assessment (~15-25% precision, 764 unique).
  Changes to concept-wba: (1) Removed broad terms that captured AI-competency and
  exam-taking noise: "clinical competenc*" (matched AI-demonstrating-competence
  articles), "formative assessment*" (too broad), "performance assessment*" (matched
  AI performance benchmarks), "clinical evaluation*" (ambiguous), "clinical supervision"
  (too broad), "competence assessment*" (too broad). (2) Added specific WBA terms:
  "competency-based assessment*" (replaces clinical competenc*), "programmatic
  assessment" (CBME-specific), "EPAs" (plural, more specific to medical education).
  (3) Kept all WBA tool names, feedback compound terms, clinical records terms.
  Concepts 1-2 unchanged.
