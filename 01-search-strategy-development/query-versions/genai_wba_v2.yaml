description: >
  v2: Refined from v1 based on preview assessment. Changes: (1) Removed standalone
  "feedback", "scoring", "grading" from concept-wba (caused massive noise from exam
  scoring, application grading, general feedback studies), replaced with compound
  terms "assessment feedback", "assessment scoring". (2) Removed "clinical performance"
  (too broad, captured AI performance in clinical tasks rather than assessment of
  clinical performance). (3) Removed "clinical assessment*" (ambiguous, captured
  clinician assessments of patients rather than assessment of clinical skills).
  (4) Added "clinical evaluation*" and "competence assessment*" as more specific terms.
  (5) Kept all WBA-specific terms intact for recall. (6) Refined arXiv replacements
  to match. Concept structure unchanged: 3 blocks AND'd.
