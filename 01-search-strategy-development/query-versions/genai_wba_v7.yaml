  v7: Refined from v6 based on human reviewer (TK) assessment of session
  20260212_genaiwbav6_a75094. Three changes: (1) Removed short/ambiguous abbreviations
  that risk lowering precision without improving recall: 'LLM'/'LLMs' from concept-genai
  (full form 'large language model*' already covers), 'EPA'/'EPAs' from concept-wba
  (full form 'entrustable professional activit*' already covers), 'DOPS' from concept-wba
  (full form 'direct observation of procedural skill*' already covers), 'WBA' from
  concept-wba (full forms 'workplace-based assessment*' etc. already cover), 'CBME' from
  concept-wba (full form 'competency-based medical education' already covers). These
  abbreviations are common in unrelated fields (EPA=Environmental Protection Agency,
  LLM=Master of Laws, DOPS/WBA/CBME=various unrelated acronyms). Empirical testing
  confirmed: only 3 articles removed vs v6, of which 2 were false positives (environmental
  science article matched by 'EPA', 2022 non-GenAI article matched by 'EPA'), and 1 was a
  commentary that would be excluded during screening. Validation recall unchanged at 2/2
  (100%). (2) Added 'GPT-4.1' and 'GPT-4.5' to concept-genai for PubMed, Scopus, and arXiv
  to cover newer OpenAI models released in 2025. These terms are EXCLUDED from the ERIC
  replacement block because ERIC's Lucene parser mishandles the period in 'GPT-4.1'/'GPT-4.5',
  parsing 'description:GPT-4.1' as 'description:GPT AND NOT 4.1', which broadly matches
  any article mentioning 'GPT' and caused +127 false positives in initial testing
  (20260213_genaiwbav7_e79f94). (3) Added ERIC-specific replacement for concept-genai to
  exclude GPT-4.1/GPT-4.5 and 'LLM'/'LLMs' (already excluded from default block). o-series
  models (o1, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini) were NOT added to any provider: 'o1'/'o3' are too short
  and ambiguous (2 chars, match blood types, ozone, etc.), hyphenated forms cause ERIC false
  positives (documented in v6), and v5 testing confirmed 0 incremental captures from o-series
  in PubMed/Scopus/arXiv since articles consistently co-occur with broader terms. GPT-5.x
  models (5.1, 5.2, 5.3) were not added as they were released too recently (Nov-Dec 2025)
  for articles to have been published and indexed.
