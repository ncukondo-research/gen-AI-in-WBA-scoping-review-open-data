# Begin Screening

Read `review.yaml` and screen the {{ARTICLE_COUNT}} articles by applying the criteria and stage-specific rules in the project instructions.

Edit `review.yaml` directly to record your decisions.

When ALL articles are processed, create a completion marker by running:
```
touch {{DONE_MARKER}}
```
