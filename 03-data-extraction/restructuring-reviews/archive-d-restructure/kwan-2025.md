# Review: kwan-2025

## Summary: PASS

All six D sub-items that were converted from scalar to structured format preserve their original detail text exactly, have accurate and concise key_finding summaries, use appropriate approach labels, and introduce no new abbreviations. Non-D fields (A, B, C, E, F) and the abbreviations section are unchanged. Scalar items ("No evidence reported" entries, D2b, D4c) remain correctly as scalars.

## Issues Found

None.

## Detail Check

### Converted sub-items (scalar to structured)

- **D1b_prompt_rubric_alignment**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (16 words): "Prompts used original QuAL definitions, then modified Evidence wording to improve classification-task alignment across dimensions." Accurate per fulltext Methods section (baseline prompt based on QuAL definitions; modified Evidence definitions developed with human rater).
  - approach: "Rubric-based prompt design" (4 words). Matches codebook recommended vocabulary.
  - No new abbreviations.

- **D1c_content_coverage**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (16 words): "All three QuAL domains were evaluated, with domain-level performance compared across prompting techniques and fine-tuning strategies." Accurate per fulltext Results/Discussion (Table 2 reports Evidence, Suggestion, Connection across all techniques).
  - approach: "Domain-specific coverage evaluation" (4 words). Matches codebook recommended vocabulary.
  - No new abbreviations.

- **D1d_expert_review**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (16 words): "Two independent raters set QuAL ground truth, and an experienced QuAL rater co-developed modified Evidence definitions." Accurate per fulltext Methods (two independent human raters using QuAL; Ingrid de Vries collaborated on modified Evidence definitions).
  - approach: "Dual-rater review with reconciliation" (5 words). Matches codebook recommended vocabulary.
  - No new abbreviations.

- **D2d_data_security**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (18 words): "Deidentified comments were processed via OpenAI API privacy settings, with no retention for training and stricter confidentiality handling." Accurate per fulltext Methods (OpenAI API/Enterprise Privacy Policy; data not retained or used for training; stricter privacy/confidentiality requirements).
  - approach: "De-identification and privacy-controlled API processing" (6 words). Descriptive and within 3-8 word range.
  - No new abbreviations.

- **D2e_quality_assurance**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (16 words): "Preprocessing removed nulls, duplicates, and encoding errors, retained rater-agreed labels, and used stratified holdout test evaluation." Accurate per fulltext Methods (Dataset Preprocessing and Preparation section).
  - approach: "Multi-step quality assurance" (4 words). Matches codebook recommended vocabulary.
  - No new abbreviations.

- **D4b_ai_human_agreement**: OK
  - detail: Exactly matches original scalar value.
  - key_finding (19 words): "Against human-rated QuAL labels, fine-tuned GPT-3.5 reached F1 0.827/0.949/0.933; GPT-4 peaked at 0.554 Evidence, 0.902 Suggestion, 0.882 Connection." Accurate per fulltext Table 2 (fine-tuned GPT-3.5: Evidence 0.827, Suggestion 0.949, Connection 0.933; GPT-4 best: Evidence 0.554 via modified prompt, Suggestion 0.902 via baseline, Connection 0.882 via modified prompt). Includes key quantitative metrics as recommended by codebook.
  - approach: "Multi-metric agreement analysis" (4 words). Matches codebook recommended vocabulary. Note: F1 is the sole reported agreement metric, though it encompasses precision and recall; label is acceptable.
  - No new abbreviations.

### Scalar preservation check

- **D2b_reasoning_transparency**: Remains scalar string ("Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques used but reasoning quality not independently examined."). Correct per codebook D2b note.
- **D2c_hallucination_assessment**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D3b_reproducibility**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D3c_inter_model_agreement**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D3d_internal_consistency**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D3e_parameter_effects**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D3f_bias_fairness**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D4c_human_raters**: Remains scalar (descriptive, not evidence per codebook). Correct.
- **D4d_discriminant_ability**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D4e_comparison_other_measures**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D5b_learner_performance_impact**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D5c_stakeholder_acceptability**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.
- **D5d_unintended_consequences**: Remains scalar "No evidence reported". Correct.

### Non-D fields check

- **Categories A, B, C**: Unchanged from original. Verified identical.
- **Category E (E1, E2, E3)**: Unchanged from original. Verified identical.
- **Category F (F1, F2, F3)**: Unchanged from original. Verified identical.
- **D_summary**: Unchanged from original. Verified identical.
- **abbreviations**: Unchanged from original. All abbreviations used in new structured fields (QuAL, F1, GPT, API) are present in the abbreviations section.
