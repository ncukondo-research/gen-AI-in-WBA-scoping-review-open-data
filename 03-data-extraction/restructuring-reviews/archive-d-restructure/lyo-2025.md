# Review: lyo-2025

## Summary: PASS

All D sub-items were correctly converted to the structured format. Detail fields are identical to the original scalar values. Key findings are concise, accurate, and free of filler. Approach labels use codebook-recommended vocabulary. Non-D fields are untouched. Scalar items ("No evidence reported" and special-case scalars) were correctly preserved.

## Issues Found

None.

## Detail Check

### Converted sub-items (structured format)

  - approach: "Domain-specific prompt alignment" (4 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D1c_content_coverage**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (16 words): Accurate; reflects predefined severity/type domains described in Methods and Table 1.
  - approach: "Construct coverage assessment" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D1d_expert_review**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (15 words): Accurate; 84.5% relevance confirmed in Results "Topics for Review" section.
  - approach: "Expert panel review" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D2c_hallucination_assessment**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (18 words): Accurate; false positive mean 3.3 and false negative mean 12 confirmed in Results and Table 2.
  - approach: "False-positive analysis as proxy" (5 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D2d_data_security**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (17 words): Accurate; institutional prohibition and IRB exemption confirmed in Datasets section of fulltext.
  - approach: "Synthetic data used" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D2e_quality_assurance**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (15 words): Accurate; three radiologists, randomized grading, and 5x reproducibility confirmed in Output Grading section.
  - approach: "Expert output review" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D3b_reproducibility**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (14 words): Accurate; ICC(2,1)=0.690, CV=0.35, weighted kappa=0.94 confirmed in Reproducibility Analysis section. Note: Fleiss' kappa=0.718 omitted from key_finding but present in detail; acceptable for summary conciseness.
  - approach: "Repeated inference runs" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D4b_ai_human_agreement**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (20 words): Accurate; F1=0.66 (severity) and 0.64 (type) confirmed in Tables 4 and 5; correlations confirmed in Results.
  - approach: "Multi-metric agreement analysis" (4 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

- **D5c_stakeholder_acceptability**: OK
  - detail: Identical to original scalar value.
  - key_finding (18 words): Accurate; 84.5% relevance and Spearman rho=0.76 confirmed in Topics for Review section.
  - approach: "Expert relevance rating" (3 words) -- matches codebook vocabulary.

### Scalar items preserved correctly

- **D2b_reasoning_transparency**: OK -- Scalar string "CoT prompting techniques used but reasoning quality not independently examined." preserved as required by codebook D2b note.
- **D3c_inter_model_agreement**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D3d_internal_consistency**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D3e_parameter_effects**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D3f_bias_fairness**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D4c_human_raters**: OK -- Scalar descriptive string preserved.
- **D4d_discriminant_ability**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D4e_comparison_other_measures**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D5b_learner_performance_impact**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).
- **D5d_unintended_consequences**: OK -- "No evidence reported" (scalar).

### Non-D fields

- **A, B, C fields**: OK -- All identical to extraction-v2.yaml (original).
- **D_summary**: OK -- Identical to original.
- **E1, E2, E3**: OK -- Identical to original.
- **F1, F2, F3**: OK -- Identical to original.
