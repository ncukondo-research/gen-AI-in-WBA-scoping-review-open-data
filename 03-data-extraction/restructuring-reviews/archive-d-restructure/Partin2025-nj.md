# Review: Partin2025-nj

## Summary: PASS

No substantive issues found. All detail fields are exact matches of the original scalar values, key_findings are accurate and concise, approach labels use codebook-recommended vocabulary, no new abbreviations are introduced, non-D fields are untouched, and scalar preservation is correct.

## Issues Found

None requiring revision.

### Minor observations (informational only, no action needed)

- [D2d approach] "De-identification procedures" is 2 words, nominally below the 3-word guideline; however, this exact phrase appears in the codebook's recommended vocabulary for D2d, so it is compliant by design.
- [D4d approach] "Training-level differentiation" is 2 words (counting the hyphenated term as one); however, this exact phrase appears in the codebook's recommended vocabulary for D4d, so it is compliant by design.
