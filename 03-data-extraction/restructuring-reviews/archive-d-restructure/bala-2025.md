## Summary: PASS

No issues requiring revision were found. All detail fields are exactly preserved from the original scalar values, key_findings are accurate and concise, approach labels are appropriate, no new abbreviations were introduced, non-D fields are untouched, and scalar "No evidence reported" items remain scalar strings.

## Issues Found

None.

## Detail Check

### D1b_prompt_rubric_alignment
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value: `"Unclear: no formal competency rubric or workplace-based assessment scoring framework was used; prompts were aligned to task-specific discrepancy detection (missed diagnoses/differentials between preliminary and final impressions)."` Note: the original (initial commit b8d3da8) used "WBA scoring framework" which was expanded to "workplace-based assessment scoring framework" in a prior abbreviation-fix commit (05d029a); the detail matches the pre-conversion committed version (4f364c4) exactly.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Iterative one- and few-shot prompt tuning aligned outputs to discrepancy detection, not to a formal competency scoring rubric." The fulltext confirms iterative prompt tuning with one-/few-shot approach (Appendix A) and confirms no formal competency rubric was used. Accurate summary.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 21 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Task-specific prompt design" (4 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D1b.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK -- No abbreviations introduced in approach or key_finding.

### D1c_content_coverage
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Prompts targeted clinically significant missed diagnoses and differentials, with qualitative checks to reduce chronic or clinically inconsequential findings." The fulltext confirms: "The model was specifically instructed to identify both missed diagnoses and differential considerations" and prompts included explicit exclusion rules for chronic/unchanged findings. Qualitative evaluation is confirmed. Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 20 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Domain-specific coverage evaluation" (4 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D1c.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D1d_expert_review
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Fourteen resident reviewers judged prediction correctness, while three senior residents adjudicated user-suggested misses by majority vote." The fulltext confirms 14 residents assessed LLM-generated discrepancies, and three senior radiology residents independently evaluated user-suggested false negatives with majority vote. Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 17 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Expert panel review" (3 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D1d.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D2b_reasoning_transparency
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- Remains scalar string `"No evidence reported"`.

### D2c_hallucination_assessment
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Of 24 model-predicted missed diagnoses, 19 were accepted as correct, indicating five incorrect outputs as indirect hallucination-proxy evidence." The fulltext confirms: "The model predicted 24 potential unique missed diagnoses... 19 diagnoses were rated as correct by 50% or more residents." The remaining 5 serve as false-positive/hallucination-proxy evidence. Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 20 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "False-positive analysis as proxy" (5 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D2c.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D2d_data_security
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Manual and regex de-identification removed HIPAA identifiers and critical-findings communications before IRB-approved processing via API." The fulltext confirms: "rigorous manual de-identification and application of custom regex patterns to match and eliminate text spans containing HIPAA identifiers" and "references indicating communication of critical findings were also excluded" and "performed through the use of the OpenAI API, as specified in the study IRB." Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 16 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "De-identification procedures" (2 words). Note: slightly below the 3-word minimum recommended in the codebook, but the codebook says "3-8 words" as guidance; 2 words is marginal but still descriptive. Minor observation, not a required revision.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK -- HIPAA and IRB already present in detail and abbreviations section.

### D2e_quality_assurance
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Prompts and outputs underwent qualitative checks, validation-subset review, a predefined >=50% consensus rule, and senior-resident adjudication of suggested misses." The fulltext confirms qualitative evaluation of prompts, validation on a subset, the 50% consensus threshold, and adjudication by 3 senior residents. Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 20 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Multi-step quality assurance" (4 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D2e.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D3b-D3f (all)
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- All five sub-items remain scalar strings `"No evidence reported"`.

### D4b_ai_human_agreement
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Resident raters judged 19/24 predictions correct with >=50% consensus, yielding 79.2% accuracy, 79.2% sensitivity, and Fleiss' kappa 0.43." The fulltext confirms: 19/24 correct at 50% consensus, prediction accuracy 79.2%, sensitivity 79.2%, Fleiss' kappa 0.43. Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 20 words, no filler phrases. Includes key quantitative metrics as required.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Multi-metric agreement analysis" (4 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D4b.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D4c_human_raters
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- Remains a scalar string, not converted to structured format.

### D4d_discriminant_ability
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- Remains scalar string `"No evidence reported"`.

### D4e_comparison_other_measures
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- Remains scalar string `"No evidence reported"`.

### D5b_learner_performance_impact
- **scalar preservation**: OK -- Remains scalar string `"No evidence reported"`.

### D5c_stakeholder_acceptability
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Mean satisfaction was 3.50/5 and perceived accuracy 3.64/5, with 71.43% preferring combined traditional and LLM feedback." The fulltext confirms: mean satisfaction 3.50, perceived accuracy 3.64 out of 5, and "71.43% (10/14) respondents expressed a preference for combined feedback." Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 18 words, no filler phrases. Includes key quantitative metrics.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Student satisfaction survey" (3 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D5c. Minor note: the fulltext describes participants as "residents" rather than "students," and the codebook vocabulary lists "Student satisfaction survey" as a recommended term. This is acceptable since residents are learner-respondents, and the codebook term is a category label.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

### D5d_unintended_consequences
- **detail preservation**: OK -- Exactly matches original scalar value.
- **key_finding accuracy**: OK -- "Approximately 20% prediction error was observed, including incorrect flagging of clinically insignificant or chronic findings as missed diagnoses." The fulltext confirms: "the model error rate (approximately 20%)" and "despite efforts to direct the model to ignore clinically insignificant and chronic findings, these findings were sometimes inaccurately flagged as missed diagnoses." Accurate.
- **key_finding conciseness**: OK -- 18 words, no filler phrases.
- **approach label**: OK -- "Empirical risk identification" (3 words). Matches recommended codebook vocabulary for D5d.
- **No new abbreviations**: OK.

## Non-D Fields Check

All A, B, C, E, F fields are identical between the pre-conversion version (commit 4f364c4) and the current restructured version. The diff shows changes exclusively within D1b, D1c, D1d, D2c, D2d, D2e, D4b, D5c, and D5d. D_summary, E1, E2, E3, F1, F2, F3, and abbreviations are all unchanged. Confirmed: non-D fields untouched.

## Abbreviations Check

New fields (approach and key_finding) use the following terms that could be abbreviations: LLM (in D5c key_finding), HIPAA (in D2d key_finding), IRB (in D2d key_finding). All three are present in the abbreviations section. No new abbreviations were introduced that are absent from the abbreviations section.
