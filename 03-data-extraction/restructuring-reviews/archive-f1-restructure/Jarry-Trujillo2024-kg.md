## Word count

- summary: 29 words

## Notes

- **detail**: The detail field contains a faithful 4-sentence narrative that accurately summarizes the study findings. All claims (20 scenarios, 96.43% usefulness, median FQ of 8, education-expert preference for ChatGPT over surgeons A and B, clinical-expert comparability, blinded source perception) are verified against the fulltext.
- **summary**: The summary is 29 words, within the 15-40 word requirement. It starts with "ChatGPT 4.0" (not "The study..." or similar filler). It states what the AI did (identified surgical errors and generated feedback from written laparoscopic cholecystectomy scenarios) and the key quantitative outcomes (96.43% resident-rated usefulness, median feedback quality of 8/10). All metrics match the fulltext (Table 1 and Results section).
- **Abbreviations**: The summary contains no abbreviations. The detail also does not use any abbreviations in abbreviated form. All abbreviations used elsewhere in the YAML (AI, CE, EDR, EE, FONDECYT, FQ, LLM, OPRS) are present in the abbreviations section.
- **Factual accuracy**: Verified against fulltext:
  - 96.43% usefulness: Confirmed in Table 1 and Results (line 110).
  - Median feedback quality of 8: Confirmed in Table 1 (FQ median 8 [7-9] from residents).
  - "8/10" framing is appropriate since the scale is 1-10 (line 79).
  - "comparable to experienced surgeons": Confirmed (p = 0.163 for resident FQ comparison, p = 0.739 for FCUR comparison; lines 110).
  - Education-expert favoring ChatGPT over surgeons A and B: Confirmed (p = 0.019 and p = 0.033; line 114).
  - Clinical-expert ratings comparable to surgeons A/C, below surgeon B: Confirmed (line 114).
  - Blinded perception as human-written: Confirmed (residents 33.9%, CE 28.5%, EE 14.3%; lines 17, 120).
- **No new abbreviations**: No abbreviations are introduced in the summary that are absent from the source article.
