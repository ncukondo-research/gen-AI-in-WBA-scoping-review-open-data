## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None. All review criteria are satisfied.

## Word count

- summary: 31 words

## Notes

- **detail field**: Faithfully preserves a 4-sentence narrative covering sample (20 students, 40 datasets), key metrics (Jaccard 0.59, kappa 0.65, specificity 99.34%, sensitivity 62.39%), the three patterns of missed experiences, and the conclusion about AI-supported log analysis reducing burden. All numbers and claims verified against fulltext.
- **summary field**: Starts with "GPT-4 Turbo extracted..." (no prohibited opening phrase). States the AI role (extracting clerkship experiences from learning logs against MCC goals) and key quantitative outcomes (Jaccard, kappa, specificity, sensitivity). Word count is 31, within the 15-40 range.
- **Abbreviations**: "MCC" is the only abbreviation used in the summary; it is defined in the fulltext as "Model Core Curriculum for Medical Education (MCC)" and is present in the YAML abbreviations section. No new abbreviations introduced.
- **Factual accuracy**: All metrics match the fulltext exactly (Jaccard 0.59, Cohen kappa 0.65, sensitivity 62.39%, specificity 99.34%).
- **Minor stylistic note (non-blocking)**: The summary writes "GPT-4 Turbo" while the fulltext and the detail field use "GPT-4-turbo" (hyphenated, lowercase). Both refer to the same model (gpt-4-0125-preview). "GPT-4 Turbo" matches OpenAI's official product naming. This does not constitute a factual error.
