## Notes

- **detail (verbatim check)**: The detail field exactly matches the original pre-restructuring flat string (verified against commit b8d3da8). It is a faithful 4-sentence narrative covering discrepancy detection/classification, AI-human agreement, reproducibility, and teaching-point relevance.
- **summary (content check)**: States what AI did (compared paired preliminary/finalized radiology reports to detect and classify discrepancies) and key quantitative outcomes (weighted F1 0.64-0.66, teaching-point relevance 84.5%). Does not begin with "The study..." or similar filler. Word count (27) is within the 15-40 word range.
- **Factual accuracy**: All metrics verified against fulltext.md:
  - Weighted overall F1 score 0.66 for severity (Table 4, line 153) and 0.64 for type (Table 5, line 165) -- matches "0.64-0.66".
  - Teaching-point relevance 84.5% (line 179) -- matches.
  - Model identified as GPT-4 Turbo (line 34) -- matches.
- **No new abbreviations**: The summary uses "GPT-4 Turbo" (product name used throughout fulltext), "F1" (used extensively in the article, e.g., Tables 4 and 5), and no other abbreviations. No new abbreviations introduced.
- **Abbreviations section**: "F1" is present in the abbreviations section. All abbreviations used in summary and detail (AI, ReXVal, F1, LLM, ICC) are accounted for in the abbreviations section.
