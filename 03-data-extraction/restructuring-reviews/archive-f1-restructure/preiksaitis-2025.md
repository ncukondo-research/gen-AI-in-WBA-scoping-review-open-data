## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None identified.

## Word count

- summary: 30 words

## Notes

- **detail**: The detail field contains 4 sentences faithfully covering the sample size (62 EM residents), method (retrieval-augmented generative AI pipeline mapping EHR documentation to 895 MCPEM topics), key quantitative outcomes (topic exposure progression from PGY1 to PGY4, 9.9% PGY3-to-PGY4 increase), workload/complexity trends, and validation (89.76% AI-expert agreement). All claims match the fulltext.
- **summary**: Concisely states the AI role (classifying ED encounters into MCPEM topics to track resident exposure) and the key quantitative outcomes (topic counts by PGY level, agreement rate). Does not begin with "The study..." or similar filler. Word count is 30, within the 15-40 range.
- **Abbreviations**: All abbreviations used in summary and detail (NLP, ED, MCPEM, PGY, ESI, SNOMED CT) are present in the abbreviations section of the YAML. No new abbreviations were introduced that are absent from the source fulltext.
- **Factual accuracy**: All numbers verified against fulltext.md: 244,255 encounters, 895 MCPEM subcategories, 376.7 mean PGY1 topics, 565.9 mean PGY4 topics, 9.9% PGY3-to-PGY4 increase (51/515), 89.76% agreement (377/420), 62 residents, 4 graduating classes. All correct.
