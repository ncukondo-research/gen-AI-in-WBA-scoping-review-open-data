# F1 Review: kwan-2025

## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None.

## Word count

- summary: 29 words

## Notes

- **detail field**: 4 sentences. Faithfully captures the study's comparison of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for automated QuAL scoring, performance variation across prompt strategies, the best fine-tuned GPT-3.5 results (F1: Evidence 0.827, Suggestion 0.949, Connection 0.933), and the conclusion about task/prompt dependency. All claims verified against the fulltext.
- **summary field**: Starts with "GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 automated..." (no prohibited opener). Clearly states the AI role (automated QuAL scoring of EPA narrative feedback) and the key quantitative outcome (fine-tuned GPT-3.5 F1 scores on holdout test set). Word count (29) is within the 15-40 range.
- **Abbreviations**: All abbreviations used in summary and detail (GPT, QuAL, EPA, F1, LLM) appear in both the fulltext and the YAML abbreviations section.
- **Factual accuracy**: All F1 scores (Evidence 0.827, Suggestion 0.949, Connection 0.933) match Table 2 in the fulltext. The claim about holdout test set evaluation is confirmed by the Methods section (stratified 80/20 train/test split with holdout for post-fine-tuning evaluation). The characterization of performance as "task- and prompt-dependent" aligns with the article's conclusions.
