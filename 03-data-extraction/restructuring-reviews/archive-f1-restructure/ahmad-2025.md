# F1 Review: ahmad-2025

## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None. All review criteria are satisfied.

## Word count

- summary: 30 words

## Notes

- **detail**: The detail field contains 4 sentences providing a faithful narrative of the study findings. It accurately covers the AI-human concordance metrics (90%/kappa 0.94 on the primary 60-entry set; 92%/kappa 0.82 on the supplementary subset), the 776-entry scaled analysis, cross-modality differences (with the SBP exception noted), and the authors' conclusion about multimodal feedback and LLMs as adjuncts.

- **summary**: Begins with "ChatGPT-4o coded..." (no prohibited filler phrase). Clearly states (a) what the AI did (coded 836 narrative feedback entries from three assessment modalities in OHNS) and (b) the key outcome (90% concordance, kappa 0.94, significant cross-modality differences). Word count of 30 is within the 15-40 range.

- **Abbreviations**: All abbreviations used in summary and detail (ChatGPT, OHNS, SIMPL-OR, OSATS, EOR, SBP, LLM) are present in the abbreviations section of the YAML. No new abbreviations were introduced that are absent from the source fulltext.

- **Factual accuracy**: All numbers verified against fulltext.md:
  - 836 total feedback entries (fulltext line 89: "A total of 836 feedback entries met inclusion criteria")
  - 90% concordance / kappa 0.94 (abstract reports kappa = 0.94; results section reports kappa = 0.941; the YAML uses the abstract-rounded value, which is acknowledged in F3b)
  - 92% concordance / kappa 0.82 on supplementary subset (fulltext line 126)
  - 776 additional entries analyzed by ChatGPT (fulltext line 91)
  - SBP as the only non-significant cross-modality comparison (p = 0.387, fulltext line 91)
  - SIMPL-OR most specific (97%) and corrective (71%); EOR highest in professionalism (40%) and ICS (12%)

- **Minor observation**: The kappa value is reported as 0.94 in the summary/detail (matching the abstract) while the results text states 0.941. This minor rounding is already documented in F3b_items_for_verification and does not constitute an error.
