## Notes

- **Summary content**: Clearly states the AI role (GPT-3.5/GPT-4 provided section-by-section feedback on M3 students' H&P notes) and key quantitative outcomes (44% very satisfied, 76% found feedback relevant, 38% hallucinations, 51% prompt-sensitivity). All four figures verified against fulltext lines 131, 135, 164-165.
- **Summary opening**: Starts with "GPT-3.5/GPT-4 provided..." -- does not use forbidden openings ("The study...", "This study...", etc.).
- **Detail faithfulness**: 4-sentence narrative accurately summarizes the study's mixed-methods design, 100-student sample, positive perceptions (personalization, critical thinking, case-based learning, relevance, efficiency, satisfaction), and identified risks (hallucinations, prompt sensitivity). All claims verified against fulltext.
- **Abbreviations**: All abbreviations used in summary and detail (M3, H&P, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, CoT) are either present in the abbreviations section or are proper model names not requiring expansion. No new abbreviations introduced.
- **Factual accuracy**: Every numeric claim in the summary matches the fulltext: 44% very satisfied (line 131), 76% relevant (line 131), 38% hallucinations (lines 135, 164), 51% prompt-sensitivity (lines 135, 165).
