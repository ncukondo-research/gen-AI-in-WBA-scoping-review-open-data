# F1 Review: Partin2025-nj

## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None. All criteria satisfied.

## Word count

- summary: 30 words

## Notes

- **detail field**: Verified verbatim match against the original pre-restructuring flat string (commit b8d3da8). All four sentences preserved exactly. Content is a faithful narrative covering main findings (correlation strength, concordance, subgroup analyses, feasibility conclusion).
- **summary field**: Does not start with "The study..." or similar filler. Clearly states the AI role (ChatGPT 4o-mini assigned ACGME milestone levels from de-identified faculty narrative comments) and key quantitative outcome (strong correlations in 15/16 domains, mean difference 0.58). Word count (30) is within the 15-40 range.
- **Factual accuracy**: All numbers verified against the fulltext.
  - "24 family medicine residents" matches fulltext (Results section).
  - "15 of 16 domains" matches fulltext: "Of the 16 areas analyzed, 15 showed a strong positive correlation."
  - "mean difference 0.58" matches fulltext: "The average mean difference between milestone levels (1-5) assigned was 0.58 for all subcompetencies and competencies."
- **No new abbreviations**: The summary uses ACGME and CCC, both of which appear in the source article fulltext and in the YAML abbreviations section.
- **Abbreviations section**: All abbreviations used in summary and detail (ACGME, CCC, AI, ICS, PGY) are listed in the abbreviations section of the YAML.
- **Minor stylistic observation** (not an issue): The summary uses "CCC ratings" whereas the fulltext consistently uses "levels" (milestone levels). The term "ratings" is not factually incorrect but is not the article's own terminology. This does not rise to the level of requiring revision.
