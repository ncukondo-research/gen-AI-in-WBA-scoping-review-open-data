# F1 Review: atsukawa-2025

## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None. All review criteria are satisfied.

- **detail**: Preserves a faithful 2-4 sentence narrative (3 sentences). Content is factually accurate: GPT-4o had the highest agreement among tested LLMs, was selected for longitudinal evaluation, C1-C3 showed significant reductions in revision rates, C4-C6 did not reach statistical significance, and the conclusion about objective feedback and reduced supervisory workload matches the article.
- **summary**: States the AI role (GPT-4o scored radiology resident reports on six revision criteria) and the key quantitative outcomes (kappa range and P-values). Does not start with "The study..." or similar. All numbers match the fulltext (kappa 0.67-0.74 for C1, C2, C6 confirmed in Table 2; P-values for C1-C3 confirmed in Table 3). No new abbreviations introduced; GPT-4o, C1-C6, and P are all used in the source article.
- **abbreviations**: All abbreviations used in summary/detail (GPT-4o, LLM, CT, MRI, AI, API) are present in the abbreviations section. C1-C6 are criterion identifiers used throughout the article rather than standalone abbreviations, so their omission from the abbreviations section is acceptable.

## Word count

- summary: 37 words

## Notes

- The kappa range "0.67-0.74" accurately represents GPT-4o agreement with both radiologists for criteria C1, C2, and C6 across Table 2 (values: 0.67, 0.70, 0.72, 0.74).
- The detail correctly characterizes C4 (P = 0.05) as "not statistically significant," consistent with the article's own framing in the Results section where C4-C6 are grouped as not showing significant changes, though C4 is at the conventional threshold boundary.
- The summary effectively balances brevity with informativeness, capturing both the agreement metrics and the longitudinal skill-improvement findings within the 40-word limit.
