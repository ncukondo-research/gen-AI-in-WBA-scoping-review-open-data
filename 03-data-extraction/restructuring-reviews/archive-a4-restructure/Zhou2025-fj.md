- **summary**: Starts with "GPT-3.5 generated..." (no prohibited filler phrase). States the AI role (generated synthetic narrative feedback; attempted source differentiation) and the key quantitative outcomes (80.5% human accuracy vs 50.0% GPT-3.5 accuracy, kappa -0.237).
- **Factual accuracy**: All numbers verified against the fulltext -- 80.5% mean human accuracy (Table 2), 50.0% GPT-3.5 accuracy (Table 2), overall Fleiss' kappa -0.237 (Table 2 and Results text). Claims about GPT-3.5 generating feedback and performing source differentiation are accurate per Methods and Results.
- **No new abbreviations**: All abbreviations in summary/detail (GPT-3.5, AI) appear in the source fulltext. No new abbreviations introduced.
- **Abbreviations section**: AI and GPT are both listed in the abbreviations section. "kappa" is a statistical term (not an abbreviation) and does not require an entry.
