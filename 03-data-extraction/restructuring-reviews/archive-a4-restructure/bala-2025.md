## Verdict: PASS

## Issues (if any)

None identified.

## Word count

- summary: 27 words

## Notes

- **detail**: The detail field is a faithful 4-sentence narrative covering method (GPT-4 via API for identifying missed diagnoses in preliminary reports), results (24 candidate misses, 19 correct, 79.2% accuracy and 79.2% sensitivity), perceptions (satisfaction 3.50/5, perceived accuracy 3.64/5, preference for hybrid feedback), and conclusion (LLMs may augment feedback but require refinement). All claims match the fulltext.
- **summary**: Starts with "GPT-4 identified..." (not "The study..."), clearly states the AI role (identifying missed diagnoses in radiology resident preliminary reports) and key quantitative outcomes (79.2% prediction accuracy, 79.2% sensitivity, mean satisfaction 3.50/5). All numbers verified against fulltext (lines 97, 101). Word count of 27 is within the 15-40 range.
- **Abbreviations**: "RPR4" used in the summary is present in both the fulltext and the YAML abbreviations section. "GPT-4" is a model/product name, not an abbreviation requiring expansion. "LLM", "API", and "RPR4" used in the detail are all present in the abbreviations section. No new abbreviations introduced.
- **Factual accuracy**: 79.2% prediction accuracy (fulltext line 97: "prediction accuracy rate of 79.2%"), 79.2% sensitivity (fulltext line 97: "sensitivity of 79.2%"), 10 RPR4 test reports (fulltext line 93), mean satisfaction 3.50/5 (fulltext line 101: "mean score was 3.50"). All verified.
