## Notes
- **summary**: Starts with "LLM-based NLP analyzed..." (no prohibited filler phrase). Clearly states AI role (LLM-based NLP analyzed feedback narratives for themes and sentiment) and key quantitative outcome (5.3% lower positive sentiment in trainee-written vs supervisor-written narratives; bias affected emotive language more than entrustment ratings). All figures verified against fulltext: N=24,187 (abstract/Table 1); -5.3% sentiment difference (abstract, Results section); conclusion about bias in emotive language vs entrustment ratings (abstract, Discussion, Conclusion).
- **detail**: 4-sentence faithful narrative. All claims cross-checked against fulltext: 24,187 dialogs confirmed; theme overlap in oral presentations and patient communication confirmed (Table 2, Discussion); -5.3% sentiment difference confirmed; +0.08 entrustment rating difference confirmed (abstract); sentiment bias by gender and UIM confirmed (Table 3); no entrustment rating subgroup differences confirmed (Table 3, Discussion).
- **Abbreviations in summary**: LLM and NLP are both used in the source article (keywords: "Natural language processing; Large language models") and are present in the YAML abbreviations section.
- **Abbreviations in detail**: UIM is used in the source article and present in YAML abbreviations section.
- **No new abbreviations introduced**: Confirmed.
- **detail preservation**: The detail text reads as a coherent pre-restructuring flat string and accurately represents the study findings.
