## Notes

- **detail**: The detail field is a faithful 4-sentence narrative covering the key results (94.4% GML classification rate, 56.3% AI-detection agreement, sensitivity/specificity, exclusion of 10 statements, and the conclusion about AI as adjunct). All numbers and claims match the fulltext (Results section, Tables 1-3, and Conclusions).
- **summary**: Concise and accurate. Correctly states the AI role (rewrote fixed mindset feedback into growth mindset language) and key quantitative outcomes (94.4% classification rate, 75% sensitivity, 65% specificity). Does not begin with "The study..." or similar filler. All figures verified against fulltext Results section.
- **Abbreviations**: "AI" and "GML" are used in the summary; "AI", "GML", "FML" are used in the detail. All are present in the abbreviations section of the YAML and are used in the source article fulltext.
- **No new abbreviations** introduced beyond those in the source article.
- **Factual accuracy**: All metrics checked against fulltext -- 94.4% (17/18) matches Table 1; sensitivity 75% and specificity 65% match Table 3 and the Results text.
