- item: D4c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 14 radiology residents with on-call experience rated model predictions;
    3 senior radiology residents adjudicated...
  recommended_value: 'Explicitly flag per Rule #9 that resident raters provide weaker
    comparator than independent attending-expert raters'
  rationale: 'D4c should more prominently note that the primary comparators are residents
    (not attending faculty), which represents a weaker ground truth per Rule #9. The
    extraction mentions this but could be more explicit.'

- item: A2_year
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: '2024'
  recommended_value: 2024 (online publication date; article folder uses 2025 likely
    reflecting print/volume date)
  rationale: The extraction correctly notes this discrepancy in F3b. The DOI resolves
    to a 2024 online publication. Folder naming uses 2025. Current coding of 2024
    is correct per DOI metadata. Adding a note would aid verification.

- item: D4b_ai_human_agreement
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI outputs were compared against human judgments: 19/24 predictions
    judged correct by resident raters using >=50% consensus (prediction accuracy 79.2%);
    sensitivity for true missed diagnoses 79.2%; interrater reliability among human
    raters Fleiss'' kappa = 0.43.'
  recommended_value: 'AI outputs were compared against human judgments: 19/24 predictions
    judged correct by resident raters using >=50% consensus (prediction accuracy 79.2%);
    sensitivity for true missed diagnoses 79.2% (19/24); interrater reliability among
    human raters Fleiss'' kappa = 0.43.'
  rationale: 'Minor: adding the fraction 19/24 to the sensitivity claim for clarity,
    since the same 19/24 produces both the accuracy and sensitivity figures. This
    is not an error but aids interpretation.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D5 correctly identified: empirical stakeholder acceptability (satisfaction
    scores, preference data) and unintended consequences (incorrect flagging of chronic
    findings)'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D2c indirect false-positive proxy correctly applied per Rule #8'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 content mapping appropriately notes task-specific rather than rubric-based
    alignment
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: A2_year uncertainty flagged (folder suggests 2025, DOI indicates 2024)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of the iterative prompt-tuning methodology (train/validation/test
    subsets)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the two-prompt sequential design
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of both D4 and D5 evidence including stakeholder satisfaction
    scores
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate flagging of the year discrepancy in F3b
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Overall a well-mapped extraction. The study provides good D4+D5 evidence with
    appropriate caveats about comparator quality.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Strong fidelity. All statistics verified. No fabricated data points.
