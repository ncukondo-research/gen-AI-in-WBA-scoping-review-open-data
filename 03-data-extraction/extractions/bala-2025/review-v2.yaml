issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'LLMs: ''Large Language Models'''
  recommended_value: (merge with LLM entry or keep both)
  rationale: Both LLM and LLMs are listed as separate entries. This is acceptable
    since both forms appear in field values, but could be consolidated. Minor style
    preference.
  source_passage: multiple fields
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'DOI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Digital Object Identifier)'''
  recommended_value: (remove entry)
  rationale: DOI appears only in F3b ('A2_year (article folder name suggests 2025
    while DOI indicates 2024 online publication)'). It does appear in a YAML field
    value, so technically valid but very marginal.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: major
  type: remove
  current_value: 'LLMs: ''Large Language Models'''
  recommended_value: (remove, keep LLM only)
  rationale: Both 'LLM' and 'LLMs' are listed as separate entries. The plural form
    'LLMs' is just the plural of LLM and should not be a separate abbreviation entry.
    This is a spurious duplicate.
  source_passage: LLM and LLMs both listed

  current_value: 'DOI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Digital Object Identifier)'''
  recommended_value: (remove)
  rationale: 'DOI does not appear in any YAML field value. It appears only in F3b
    as extractor commentary about metadata (''A2_year (article folder name suggests
    2025 while DOI indicates 2024...''). However, scanning carefully: ''DOI'' does
    appear in the F3b text. This is borderline but DOI is an extractor-introduced
    term not from the article. Per codebook: ''Only list abbreviations that actually
    appear in the values.'' It does appear in a value, but it''s extractor commentary.
    I''ll flag as major since DOI was explicitly removed from extraction fields per
    codebook v1.5.'
  source_passage: 'F3b: ''DOI indicates 2024'''

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''Artificial Intelligence'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Artificial intelligence'''
  rationale: 'Cross-article consistency: most articles use lowercase ''intelligence'''
  source_passage: Multiple fields use 'AI'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'LLM: Large Language Model; LLMs: Large Language Models'
  recommended_value: 'Consolidate to single entry: LLM: Large Language Model'
  rationale: LLM and LLMs are the same abbreviation in singular/plural. Per convention,
    a single entry suffices.

  current_value: 'IRB: Not defined in text (likely: Institutional Review Board)'
  recommended_value: 'IRB: Not defined in text (likely: Institutional Review Board)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''IRB-approved'' (line 63) without spelling
    out the full form. Current coding is correct.'

  current_value: 'HIPAA: Not defined in text (likely: Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act)'
  recommended_value: 'HIPAA: Not defined in text (likely: Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: fulltext uses ''HIPAA identifiers'' (line 71) without spelling
    it out. Current coding is correct.'

  current_value: 'RPR4: RPR4 (disagree), within the picklist reconciliation of preliminary
    report (RPR) macro'
  recommended_value: 'RPR: picklist reconciliation of preliminary report'
  rationale: The definition is oddly structured. RPR is defined in the fulltext as
    'picklist reconciliation of preliminary report (RPR) macro' (line 55). RPR4 is
    a specific category within it. Consider simplifying to just RPR.

  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'DOI: Not defined in text (likely: Digital Object Identifier)'
  recommended_value: (remove DOI entirely)
  rationale: DOI does not appear in the extraction field values. It appeared only
    in F3b as a note about year discrepancy. Per codebook rule, only abbreviations
    appearing in field values should be listed.

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields identical to backup. No content drift.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Comprehensive abbreviation list including HIPAA, JSON, MRNs, RPR4.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good coverage of technical abbreviations (JSON, HIPAA, MRNs)
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: RPR4 definition is study-specific and well explained
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Thorough coverage of technical abbreviations (JSON, MRNs, API).
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct definitions for LLM, AI, and appropriate 'not defined' flags.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: The duplicate LLM/LLMs entry is the main issue requiring revision. DOI removal
    is borderline but aligns with codebook v1.5 which removed DOI from extraction
    fields.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. DOI and LLMs/LLM consolidation are minor cleanup items.
- reviewer: team-lead
  text: 'Lightweight post-fix review: Removed spurious LLMs duplicate and DOI entry
    not in YAML values. Fixes verified, validate_yaml.py passes. Approved.'
