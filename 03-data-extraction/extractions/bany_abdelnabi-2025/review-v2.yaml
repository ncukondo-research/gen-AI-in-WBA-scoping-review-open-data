issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research Question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: RQ3 appears in F2 value text. Defensible.
  source_passage: F2_rq3_relevance
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''artificial intelligence'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Artificial intelligence'''
  rationale: 'Cross-article consistency: capitalizing ''Artificial'' aligns with majority
    of other articles'
  source_passage: Multiple fields use 'AI'
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'WBA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Workplace-based assessment)'''
  rationale: WBA appears in F2 field value. Most other articles include it.
  source_passage: 'F2: ''AI in WBA'''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CoT: Chain-of-thought'
  recommended_value: 'CoT: Chain-of-thought'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext defines ''Chain-of-thought (CoT)'' at line 45.
    Current coding is correct. Note capitalization difference between extraction (''Chain-of-thought'')
    and some fulltext instances (''chain of thought'') - minor style issue only.'
  source_passage: Lines 45, 117 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'H&P1: Not defined in text (likely: History and Physical task 1)'
  recommended_value: 'H&P1: Not defined in text (likely: History and Physical task
    1)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: H&P1 is used in the methods (line 87) as a task label without
    explicit definition beyond context. Current coding is appropriate.'
  source_passage: Line 87 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'IRB: Not defined in text (likely: Institutional Review Board)'
  recommended_value: 'IRB: Not defined in text (likely: Institutional Review Board)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''IRB exempted by UCF IRB'' (line 93) without
    spelling out the full form. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 93 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (not listed)
  recommended_value: 'ML: Machine learning'
  rationale: 'ML is defined in the fulltext (''machine learning (ML)'' at line 35)
    and appears in the extraction field value A5_study_aim indirectly referenced.
    However, checking the extraction: ML does not actually appear in any extraction
    field value. So no addition needed.'
  source_passage: N/A - not in field values

- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good coverage of study-specific abbreviations (H&P, H&P1, H&P2, HPI, M3, UCF)
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean formatting with consistent 'Not defined in text' pattern
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate identification of defined vs. undefined abbreviations.

notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
