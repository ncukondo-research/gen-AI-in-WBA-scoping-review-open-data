- item: D2c_hallucination_assessment
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Yes: 38% of students reported occasionally encountering hallucinations
    (false or logically incorrect information).'
  recommended_value: 'Yes: 38% of students reported occasionally encountering hallucinations
    (false or logically incorrect information).'
  rationale: 'This is direct hallucination evidence (not indirect proxy), yet coded
    simply as ''Yes:'' while other files distinguish ''Yes (indirect: false-positive
    analysis as proxy)''. The distinction is correct here since this is self-reported
    hallucination observation, not proxy. But for synthesis consistency, it may be
    worth labeling as ''Yes (direct: student-reported hallucinations)''.'

- item: D4a_evidence_present
  severity: minor
  type: verify
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: Correctly coded. There is no AI-human comparison in this study. The AI
    generates feedback but is not compared against expert ratings. Consistent with
    codebook definition.

- item: D1a
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Yes'
  recommended_value: Consider whether prompt-section alignment alone meets D1 threshold
    without expert content review
  rationale: 'D1a is coded as Yes based on D1b prompt alignment to H&P sections. This
    is a borderline case: the prompts were structured by H&P sections and expected
    clinical elements, which shows intentional content alignment. However, no expert
    review (D1d) or formal coverage evaluation (D1c) was done. The coding is defensible
    because the prompt design explicitly targets assessment-relevant H&P domains,
    but it represents weaker D1 evidence than studies with expert content review.'

- item: D5c_stakeholder_acceptability
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'Student acceptability was reported quantitatively: 44% very satisfied,
    37% neutral, 19% dissatisfied; 70% reported in-depth feedback, 76% relevance to
    learning, 83% efficiency, and 88% empathetic/compassionate interaction.'
  recommended_value: 'Student acceptability was reported quantitatively: 44% very
    satisfied, 37% neutral, 19% dissatisfied; 70% found feedback in-depth, 76% found
    it relevant to learning, 83% found it efficient, and 88% found interaction empathetic/compassionate.'
  rationale: Minor rephrasing for clarity. The percentages are accurate against the
    fulltext.

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D5 evidence correctly identified across all three sub-items (D5b, D5c, D5d).
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D2b correctly uses codebook-specified phrase 'CoT prompting techniques used
    but reasoning quality not independently examined.'
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: One of the few studies with D5 evidence across multiple sub-items.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2c hallucination evidence correctly captured from student self-report (38%
    occasional hallucinations)
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D5 mapping is excellent: empirical acceptability (satisfaction percentages),
    perceived impact (self-reported learning benefit), and unintended consequences
    (hallucinations, prompt sensitivity)'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4a correctly coded as No (no AI-human comparator design)
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D2b CoT correctly coded per codebook note: ''CoT prompting techniques used
    but reasoning quality not independently examined'''
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of the mixed-methods design with both quantitative survey
    and qualitative components
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the H&P1 vs H&P2 design difference (non-interactive vs interactive)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of the hallucination reporting (38%) and prompt sensitivity
    (51%)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate coding of D4 as absent (no AI-human agreement comparison)
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good extraction of a study with an unusual profile (strong D5, no D4). Well-handled.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: This is one of the few studies with strong D5 evidence and no D4 evidence,
    which is correctly reflected in the D_summary.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Extraction faithfully represents all reported statistics and methodological
    details.
