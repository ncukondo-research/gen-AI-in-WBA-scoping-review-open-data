- item: D2c_hallucination_assessment
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy): In source-classification,
    GPT-3.5 had 50.0% accuracy, 18.2% recall for AI-generated comments, and 81.8%
    specificity for human-written comments, indicating frequent source-misattribution
    errors.'
  recommended_value: Current coding is acceptable but should be noted in F3b as an
    interpretive stretch.
  rationale: 'The R1 review raised a valid concern that the Zhou study''s source-differentiation
    task (identifying human vs AI comments) is not a standard false-positive analysis
    of AI assessment outputs against a clinical ground truth. The ''false positive''
    here is GPT-3.5 misclassifying comment sources, not fabricating clinical content.
    However, the v2 extraction has addressed this by adding explicit classification
    metrics and clarifying what the proxy refers to (source-misattribution errors).
    The coding is now internally consistent with Rule #8''s intent (AI outputs not
    matching ground truth), though the ground truth here is comment source rather
    than clinical accuracy. This is a reasonable interpretive stretch that should
    remain flagged in F3c (which it already is). No change needed.'

- item: D2c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy): In source-classification,
    GPT-3.5 had 50.0% accuracy, 18.2% recall for AI-generated comments, and 81.8%
    specificity for human-written comments, indicating frequent source-misattribution
    errors.'
  recommended_value: 'Keep current but note in F3b that this is a broader application
    of Rule #8: the ''false positives'' here are source-misattribution errors in a
    classification task rather than hallucinated clinical content.'
  rationale: The Round 1 framework-reviewer noted that source-differentiation misclassification
    differs from clinical content hallucination. The v2 extraction added classification
    metrics (which is good) but the conceptual distinction could be noted. This is
    an interpretive mapping issue rather than a factual error.

- item: F3a_overall
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Medium-High: Most fields are explicitly reported; some mapping judgments
    were required for D1 content-validity and D2c indirect hallucination proxy.'
  recommended_value: No change needed (informational note only)
  rationale: The confidence level 'Medium-High' is not one of the codebook's standard
    values (High, Medium, Low). However, other approved finals also use non-standard
    confidence (e.g., Gin-2024 uses 'Medium-High'). Since the approved corpus already
    contains this pattern, no change is strictly required. Flagging for awareness
    only.

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1a correctly changed to 'No' per R1 framework-reviewer recommendation. The
    content comparison between human and GPT comments (length, specificity, clinical
    detail) is correctly reclassified as study findings rather than content validity
    evidence. D1b, D1c, D1d all correctly set to 'No evidence reported'.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D_summary updated to reflect D1 absence: now correctly lists D1 as absent.'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2c clarified with explicit metrics per R1 consistency-reviewer feedback.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: A5d clarified per R1 fidelity-reviewer feedback.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping remains accurate with kappa values and accuracy metrics properly
    reported.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Round 1 major issue addressed: D1a reclassified from ''Yes'' to ''No''; D1c
    changed from content-characteristic comparison to ''No evidence reported''. This
    correctly recognizes that descriptive quality comparison is study findings, not
    content validity evidence.'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Round 1 minor issues addressed: D2c now includes specific classification
    metrics (50.0% accuracy, 18.2% recall, 81.8% specificity); A5d now specifies ''GPT-3.5''
    for synthetic comments.'

  text: 'D_summary format consistent with approved finals (''Primary: D4 (...). Secondary:

  text: Null-value phrasing correct across all D sub-items.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: YAML structure passes validation.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: F3c correctly retains D2c and D1c as uncertain flags.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All R1 major issues have been correctly addressed. The D1 reclassification
    was the primary change and is well executed. The D2c coding remains an interpretive
    boundary case but is adequately flagged.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good revision. The D1 reclassification is the key structural improvement.
    The D2c coding remains an interpretive mapping choice that should be applied consistently
    across studies.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Well-handled revision. D2c now includes quantitative detail consistent with
    other indirect-proxy codings (e.g., Lyo-2025, Bala-2025). The unusual study design
    (source differentiation) is appropriately flagged.
