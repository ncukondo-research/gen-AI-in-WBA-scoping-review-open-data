- item: D2c_hallucination_assessment
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy)'
  recommended_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy): GPT-3.5 source-classification
    accuracy was 50% (chance-level), with recall 18.2% and specificity 81.8%.'
  rationale: Other files with indirect D2c proxy coding include brief quantitative
    details. Adding the key metrics would improve consistency.

- item: D1a/D1c
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: D1a=Yes; D1c describes content characteristic comparison
  recommended_value: D1a=No; reclassify D1c content comparison as study findings rather
    than content validity evidence
  rationale: The D1 content validity evidence should demonstrate that the AI assessment
    adequately represents the construct being measured. The Zhou study compares characteristics
    of human vs GPT comments (length, specificity, clinical detail) as study FINDINGS,
    not as evidence that the AI's assessment content is valid. This is a descriptive
    analysis of output quality rather than an evaluation of whether AI outputs align
    with an assessment rubric or cover intended competency domains. The content comparison
    belongs under F1/F2 (findings) rather than D1 (content validity). D1b is correctly
    coded as 'No evidence reported' (no rubric alignment), and D1d is correctly 'No
    evidence reported' (no expert content review). Without D1b or D1d, D1a should
    be No.

- item: D2c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy)'
  recommended_value: Needs clarification of what false-positive analysis is being
    referenced
  rationale: 'The study involves source differentiation (identifying human vs AI comments),
    not a false-positive analysis of AI assessment outputs against a ground truth.
    The D2c coding should specify what constitutes the ''false positive'' in this
    context. If GPT-3.5 misclassifies sources, that is a task performance error, not
    a hallucination proxy. The indirect false-positive coding per Rule #8 may not
    apply here as the study''s primary task is source differentiation rather than
    assessment of clinical content accuracy.'
  source_passage: fulltext Methods and Results sections
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: A5d_num_documents
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 110 parsed human feedback sentences analyzed; 110 synthetic comments
    generated (220 total for source-classification task)
  recommended_value: 110 parsed human feedback sentences analyzed; 110 synthetic GPT-3.5
    comments generated (220 total for source-classification and quality-comparison
    tasks)
  rationale: Minor clarification that the synthetic comments were generated by GPT-3.5
    specifically.

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D sub-items correctly use 'No evidence reported'.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean and well-organized structure.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping correctly captures the low agreement (kappa -0.237) and contrasts
    with human-human agreement
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2d privacy/de-identification coding is accurate
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of the kappa statistics (Fleiss' kappa -0.237 for GPT-human;
    Cohen's kappa 0.502 for human-human)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct capture of accuracy metrics (human 80.5% vs GPT 50.0%)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good identification of the dual AI role (feedback generation + feedback analysis/coding)
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: 'D2c coding is substantively correct per rule #8 but could include more specifics
    for cross-study synthesis consistency.'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The D1 and D2c issues are the primary concerns. The study design (source differentiation)
    is somewhat unusual for the WBA AI literature, which makes framework mapping more
    challenging.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Extraction faithfully represents the fulltext. No hallucinated data.
