issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: RQ3 appears in F2 value text. Defensible.
  source_passage: F2_rq3_relevance
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: major
  type: remove
  current_value: 'LLMs: ''Large language models'''
  recommended_value: (remove; if LLM is used in field values, add as LLM instead)
  rationale: 'Only the plural ''LLMs'' is listed but not the base form ''LLM''. Scanning
    field values: E2 uses ''LLMs'', E1 uses ''LLMs''. The abbreviation entry should
    use the base form. However, if only ''LLMs'' appears in field values, it could
    be kept. Let me check if ''LLM'' (singular) appears: F2 uses ''LLM'' in... no.
    The issue is that ''LLMs'' as a separate entry from ''LLM'' is inconsistent with
    other articles. Most articles list ''LLM'' as the base abbreviation. This is a
    cross-article consistency issue.'
  source_passage: 'E2: ''Fine-tune LLMs''; E1: ''Limited data supplied to GPT-3.5'''

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'WBA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Workplace-based assessment)'''
  rationale: WBA appears in F2 field value.
  source_passage: 'F2: ''WBA-AI studies'''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'PII: Not defined in text (likely: Personally identifiable information)'
  recommended_value: 'PII: Not defined in text (likely: Personally identifiable information)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''automated PII removal using the Presidio
    Python library'' (line 78) without spelling out PII. However, checking if PII
    appears in extraction field values - it appears in D2d. Current ''Not defined
    in text'' coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 78 of fulltext.md

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'PGY: Not defined in text (likely: Postgraduate year)'
  recommended_value: 'PGY: Not defined in text (likely: Postgraduate year)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: checking the fulltext, PGY is used but not defined with parenthetical
    expansion. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'LLMs: Large language models'
  recommended_value: 'LLM: Large language model (or consolidate LLMs to LLM)'
  rationale: 'Minor: typically a single entry for the abbreviation stem is sufficient.'
  source_passage: N/A

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields identical to backup. No content drift.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Good abbreviation list with CBME, EPA, GPT, PII, PGY, LLMs.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean and focused abbreviation list
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: PII properly included
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate definitions for EPA, CBME, GPT, API.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of PII and PGY as not explicitly defined.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: The main issue is the LLMs vs LLM convention. Recommend changing to base form
    'LLM' for cross-article consistency.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. Clean abbreviation list.
- reviewer: team-lead
  text: 'Lightweight post-fix review: Replaced LLMs with base form LLM; added LLM
    definition. Fixes verified, validate_yaml.py passes. Approved.'
