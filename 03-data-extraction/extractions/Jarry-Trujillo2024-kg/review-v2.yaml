issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'OCR: ''Not defined in text (likely: Optical Character Recognition)'''
  recommended_value: (remove entry)
  rationale: OCR appears only in F3a_overall and F3b fields. It does appear in YAML
    field values, so technically valid per rules. Minor style question only.
  source_passage: F3a_overall, F3b

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research Question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: RQ3 appears in F2 field value text. Borderline but defensible.

  type: remove
  current_value: 'OCR: ''Not defined in text (likely: Optical Character Recognition)'''
  recommended_value: (remove)
  rationale: OCR appears only in F3b ('OCR/formatting artifacts'). This is extractor-introduced
    commentary, not a term from the article. However, it does appear in a field value.
    Borderline.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'LLM: ''large language models'''
  recommended_value: 'LLM: ''Large language model'''
  rationale: 'Cross-article consistency: most articles use singular form and capitalize
    ''Large'''
  source_passage: Multiple field values use 'LLM'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'OCR: Not defined in text (likely: Optical Character Recognition)'
  recommended_value: (remove OCR entirely)
  rationale: OCR does not appear in any extraction field values. It appears only in
    F3b as a comment about the fulltext rendering quality. Per codebook rule, only
    abbreviations appearing in field values should be listed.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'ICC: Not present in abbreviations list'
  recommended_value: 'Consider adding ICC: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient'
  rationale: 'ICC appears in the C2/FQ assessment section of the fulltext (line 96)
    and is defined there. If ICC appears in any field value (checking: it does not
    appear in the extraction field values), then it need not be listed. ICC does not
    appear in extraction field values so this is not required.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields identical to backup. No content changes.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Good coverage of study-specific abbreviations (CE, EE, EDR, FQ, OPRS).
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good coverage of study-specific abbreviations (CE, EE, EDR, FQ, FONDECYT)
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Properly formatted with consistent 'Not defined in text' pattern
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate definitions for CE (Clinical-Expert), EE (Education-Expert), EDR
    (Error Detection Rate), FQ (Feedback Quality).
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of OPRS as defined in the text.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate 'Not defined in text' coding for API, COI, FONDECYT, QA, RQ3,
    WBA.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean and complete abbreviation section. Minor formatting alignment with cross-article
    conventions would improve consistency.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. OCR is a minor cleanup item. The abbreviation IQR is used
    in the fulltext (defined as Interquartile Range) but does not appear in extraction
    field values, so correctly omitted.
