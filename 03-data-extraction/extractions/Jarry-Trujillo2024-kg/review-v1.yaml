- item: study_id
  severity: minor
  type: standardize
  current_value: Jarry-Trujillo-2024
  recommended_value: Jarry-Trujillo-2024
  rationale: Hyphenated multi-word last name is correctly handled. No change needed.
  source_passage: ''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: B2_api_or_interface
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: Not reported
  rationale: Correctly coded as Not reported. Consistent with codebook convention
    for non-D items.

- item: D2c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy)'
  recommended_value: Current coding is acceptable but could be more precisely characterized
  rationale: 'The false-positive proxy coding per Rule #8 is applied consistently.
    The study reports that AI and surgeons correctly classified all 6 non-error and
    14 error scenarios, which is more of an accuracy/classification analysis than
    a false-positive analysis per se. The coding is defensible but the evidence is
    better described as ''correct classification rate'' rather than ''false-positive
    analysis.'' Maintaining current coding for consistency.'

- item: D5c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: Residents judged ChatGPT feedback useful in 96.43% of assessments...
  recommended_value: Keep current coding; note that resident raters were evaluating
    perceived utility rather than true stakeholder acceptability of implementation
  rationale: D5c coding as empirical acceptability is reasonable since quantitative
    perception data from residents exists. However, these are ratings of feedback
    quality/usefulness in a research setting rather than acceptance of AI-in-assessment
    implementation. This is a borderline but acceptable interpretation.

- item: B2_api_or_interface
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: Not reported (likely web interface based on ChatGPT 4.0 commercial
    version description)
  rationale: The fulltext states 'ChatGPT 4.0 (commercial version, August 2023)' which
    typically implies web interface, but is not explicitly stated. Current coding
    of 'Not reported' is acceptable but could note the inference.
  source_passage: Methods section describing AI tool
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: D3a_evidence_present
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: The extraction reports ICC = 0.56 in F3b_items_for_verification but does
    not include it in D3. The ICC 0.56 for the FQ scale is actually interobserver
    reliability of the human-rated FQ scoring instrument, not AI reliability per se,
    so D3a = No is correct. This is a note for verification rather than a change needed.

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: 'D2c correctly coded as indirect false-positive proxy per codebook rule #8.'
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D5c stakeholder acceptability correctly identified from resident usefulness
    ratings.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good detail in F3b items for verification.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D1 mapping is well done: prompt-rubric alignment (OPRS-based), content coverage
    (scenario selection rationale), and expert review (CE and EE)'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D3a correctly coded as No per Rule #6 threshold'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D5a correctly coded as Yes based on empirical resident perception data
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate capture of the error detection metrics (14/14 errors identified,
    6/6 non-errors correctly classified)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good extraction of Education Expert vs Clinical Expert rating distinctions
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate coding of D5c stakeholder acceptability from resident usefulness
    ratings
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: A5 coding uses document-level analysis convention appropriately. All sub-items
    present.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Overall a strong extraction with appropriate framework mappings.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Extraction is generally faithful to the fulltext. The prompt text in the original
    paper appears partially garbled due to OCR/figure rendering, which the extraction
    acknowledges. No hallucinated data points found.
