C1_wba_tools: "Other: scenario-based assessment of laparoscopic cholecystectomy technical performance and feedback quality"
C2_assessment_context: |
  Formative feedback context in surgical training. Real operative situations from laparoscopic cholecystectomy were converted into brief neutral text scenarios; ChatGPT and surgeons identified errors and generated feedback, then residents and experts rated usefulness and quality in a blinded workflow.

D1_content:
  D1a_evidence_present: "Yes"
  D1b_prompt_rubric_alignment: |
    The prompt explicitly instructed identification/naming of errors and brief feedback "based on clinical experience and the Operative Performance Rating System (OPRS) scale" for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
  D1c_content_coverage: |
    Scenario set was intentionally selected to represent "relevant mistakes, common mistakes, risky situations, and desirable movements," indicating planned coverage of key procedural content domains.
  D1d_expert_review: |
    Outputs were reviewed by human experts: a Clinical Expert assessed usefulness, quality, and error naming (EDR), and an Education Expert assessed feedback quality; this provided expert appraisal of AI content appropriateness.

D2_response_process:
  D2a_evidence_present: "Yes"
  D2b_reasoning_transparency: "No evidence reported"
  D2c_hallucination_assessment: |
    Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy). AI and surgeons correctly classified all 6 non-error scenarios as "no error detected," and identified all 14 predefined error scenarios; this functions as indirect grounding/error analysis.
  D2d_data_security: "No evidence reported"
  D2e_quality_assurance: |
    Quality-control steps included calibration/standardization of scenario selection by trained surgeons, validation of scenario text transformation by a second surgeon, and identical instruction delivery to surgeons and ChatGPT for equitable comparison.

D3_internal_structure:
  D3a_evidence_present: "No"
  D3b_reproducibility: "No evidence reported"
  D3c_inter_model_agreement: "No evidence reported"
  D3d_internal_consistency: "No evidence reported"
  D3e_parameter_effects: "No evidence reported"
  D3f_bias_fairness: "No evidence reported"

D4_relationship_to_other_variables:
  D4a_evidence_present: "Yes"
  D4b_ai_human_agreement: |
    AI performance was compared against human evaluators with quantitative outcomes: residents rated ChatGPT feedback useful 96.43% of the time (comparable to surgeons B/C); median feedback quality was 8 (no significant difference vs surgeons in resident ratings, p=0.163). Clinical Expert EDR for ChatGPT was 85.71% (vs surgeons A 85.71%, B 100%, C 71.40%). Education Expert rated ChatGPT FQ significantly higher than surgeons A and B (p=0.019; p=0.033).
  D4c_human_raters: |
    Human comparators included 3 experienced surgeons (weekly resident proctoring in laparoscopic cholecystectomy), 4 general surgery residents (feedback utility/quality ratings), 1 Clinical Expert surgeon with educational background, and 1 Education Expert with technology-mediated feedback expertise.
  D4d_discriminant_ability: |
    The system distinguished error-containing from non-error scenarios: all 14 predefined error scenarios were identified and all 6 non-error scenarios were correctly labeled as no error.
  D4e_comparison_other_measures: |
    AI prompting referenced OPRS, but no formal comparison of AI outputs against an established external assessment instrument score was reported.

D5_consequences:
  D5a_evidence_present: "Yes"
  D5b_learner_performance_impact: "No evidence reported"
  D5c_stakeholder_acceptability: |
    Empirical acceptability/perception data were reported. Residents judged ChatGPT feedback useful in 96.43% of assessments; experts and residents provided quality ratings, and source-blinding results showed ChatGPT outputs were often perceived as human (residents 33.9%, CE 28.5%, EE 14.3%).
  D5d_unintended_consequences: "No evidence reported"

D_summary: "Primary: D4 (quantitative AI-human comparative performance evidence) and D5 (stakeholder acceptability/perception). Secondary: D1 (prompt-rubric alignment and expert content review), D2 (indirect hallucination proxy and QA procedures). Absent: D3 (no reproducibility, internal consistency, parameter sensitivity, or bias/fairness analyses)."

E1_limitations: |
  - Single-procedure scope: only laparoscopic cholecystectomy scenarios, potentially limiting generalizability to higher-variability procedures.
  - Limited scenario dataset: 20 scenarios total, with feedback analysis based on 14 error-containing scenarios.
  - Prompt dependence/context sensitivity acknowledged; performance may vary with prompt/request design.
  - Text-only modality; no multimodal (video/frame) AI assessment tested.
  - Feedback quality measured with a simple 1-10 scale; authors note lack of validated scales for LLM-feedback contexts.

E2_future_research: |
  - Apply the methodology across multiple disciplines to benchmark LLM feedback against reference trainers.
  - Develop/validate feedback quality assessment tools suitable for LLM-mediated contexts.
  - Conduct multidimensional AI validation (accuracy, reliability, bias, cost-effectiveness).
  - Investigate textual cues that reveal AI vs human feedback origin.
  - Expand to multimodal AI (text + image/video) for richer scenario analysis and feedback.
  - Study algorithms linking image/video recognition with predefined written situations to improve relevance of LLM feedback.

F1_key_findings_summary: |
  In this cross-sectional exploratory study using 20 real-scenario-derived surgical vignettes, ChatGPT 4.0 identified technical errors at rates comparable to experienced surgeons and generated feedback generally rated as useful and good quality by residents and experts. Resident-rated usefulness for ChatGPT feedback was 96.43%, and median feedback quality was similar to surgeons in resident assessments. Education-expert ratings favored ChatGPT over two surgeons, while clinical-expert ratings were comparable to surgeons A/C and below surgeon B. Blinded source identification showed ChatGPT feedback was frequently perceived as human-written.

F2_rq3_relevance: |
  The study highlights key generative-AI methodological gaps relevant to RQ3: strong dependence on prompt design/context, limited reproducibility reporting (no repeat-run stability metrics), and absence of formal bias/fairness subgroup testing despite discussion of bias as an important future validation target. It also illustrates a practical comparative design (LLM vs expert trainers using identical instructions and blinded multi-rater output evaluation) that could be reused in future WBA studies.

F3_confidence:
  F3a_overall: "Medium: Most fields were directly extractable, but OCR/formatting artifacts in the prompt figure and incomplete metadata on interface details introduce minor uncertainty."
  F3b_items_for_verification: |
    - B2_api_or_interface: ChatGPT access modality (web vs API) not explicitly stated.
    - B3a_prompt_reported: Figure text is partially garbled in available fulltext rendering; may affect whether this should be coded as full vs partial prompt reporting.
    - D2c_hallucination_assessment: coded via indirect false-positive proxy mapping per rule #8; verify consistency with review team conventions.
    - A5 participant framing: study is document/scenario-based but includes multiple human evaluator groups; confirm preferred coding convention for A5a/A5c.
