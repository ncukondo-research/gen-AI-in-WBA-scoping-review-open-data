issues:
- item: D4b
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: Yes (association/correlation, not direct agreement)
  recommended_value: Keep current coding but add clarification that comparators include
    both trainee self-report and faculty supervisor ratings
  rationale: 'The D4 coding correctly identifies this as association/correlation rather
    than direct agreement. The multilevel ordinal logistic regression relating AI-derived
    themes to entrustment ratings is appropriately classified. However, D4c should
    more clearly distinguish that the trainee-documented ratings are self-report (weaker
    comparator per Rule #9) while supervisor-documented ratings are faculty assessment
    (stronger comparator).'

  type: rephrase
  current_value: Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) by Google; BERT-PubMed-based sentiment
    classifier (trained on SST-2 and LMRD; final model retrained with gender-neutralized
    LMRD)
  recommended_value: Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) by Google; PubMedBERT-based
    sentiment classifier (trained on SST-2 and LMRD; final model retrained with gender-neutralized
    LMRD)
  rationale: Fulltext uses 'PubMedBERT' not 'BERT-PubMed'. Minor naming precision
    issue.

- item: A5c_sample_size
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: 552 trainees
  recommended_value: 552 trainees; 4926 supervisors who documented feedback
  rationale: The fulltext reports both 552 trainees and the supervisor count. Since
    supervisors also participated in the study, this context aids interpretation.

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'Excellent D3f mapping: empirical bias analyses (gender pronoun bias in model,
    subgroup sentiment differences by gender/UIM) correctly placed under Internal
    Structure per Rule #11'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'Correct use of ''Not applicable (non-generative model)'' for B3 items per
    Rule #10'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D5a correctly coded as No since no empirical consequence/impact data reported
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of the non-generative AI design with appropriate 'Not
    applicable' coding for prompt-related fields
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the D3f bias/fairness evidence including the pre-mitigation
    algorithmic bias testing
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of the mixed comparator strength for D4c
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The D_summary is well-constructed and accurately reflects the evidence profile.
    D1 content validity through expert-reviewed thematic coding is appropriately classified
    as secondary evidence.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major fidelity issues found. The extraction accurately represents the fulltext
    content across all categories.
