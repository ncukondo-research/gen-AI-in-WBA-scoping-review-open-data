issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research Question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove entry)
  rationale: RQ3 appears only in F2_rq3_relevance where it is part of the field key
    name, not a value abbreviation. However, it does appear in the prose text of F2
    ('relevant to RQ3'), so this is borderline acceptable. Minor style issue only.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'ID: ''Not defined in text (likely: identifier)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: ID appears as part of 'study ID 20-32478' in D2d. This is borderline;
    'ID' is used as an abbreviation in the value text, so listing it is defensible.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'ID: ''Not defined in text (likely: identifier)'''
  recommended_value: (remove)
  rationale: Scanning the YAML field values, 'ID' does not appear as an abbreviation
    in any field value. The codebook says 'Do NOT include abbreviations absent from
    the current extraction's field values.'
  source_passage: No field value contains the abbreviation 'ID'

  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research Question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove)
  rationale: 'RQ3 appears only in F2_rq3_relevance field content, which is the extractor''s
    own commentary using the project''s research question label. The field key itself
    is ''F2_rq3_relevance'' but looking at the value text, ''RQ3'' does appear in
    it. Actually, scanning F2: ''relevant to RQ3''. This is borderline since RQ3 is
    a project term, not an article term. However per codebook rule, it appears in
    field values, so listing it is technically correct.'

  current_value: 'QA: ''Not defined in text (likely: quality assurance)'''
  recommended_value: 'QA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Quality assurance)'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency in capitalization of the likely expansion
  source_passage: D2e uses 'QA' implicitly in heading context

  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'BERT: Not defined in text (likely: Bidirectional Encoder Representations
    from Transformers)'
  recommended_value: 'BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers'
  rationale: 'The fulltext references section (Devlin et al., 2019) includes ''BERT:
    Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding'',
    and the text mentions ''BERT-PubMed-a specialized version of the LLM, BERT'' with
    the citation. While not an inline parenthetical definition like ''(BERT)'', the
    term is sufficiently defined through the cited title. However, this is borderline
    and the ''Not defined in text'' coding is also defensible.'

  current_value: 'EPA: Not defined in text (likely: Entrustable Professional Activities)'
  recommended_value: 'EPA: Not defined in text (likely: Entrustable Professional Activities)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: EPA does not appear as an abbreviation in the main text body.
    The term ''EPAs'' appears only in a reference title (Marty et al., 2021). Current
    coding is correct.'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'OR: odds ratio'
  recommended_value: 'OR: Not defined in text (likely: Odds ratio)'
  rationale: The fulltext uses 'OR' in Table 2 headers alongside beta coefficients
    but does not explicitly spell out 'odds ratio (OR)' in running text. However,
    the context makes the meaning unambiguous from the table legend.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'PCA: principal component analysis'
  recommended_value: 'PCA: principal component analysis'
  rationale: 'Confirmed defined at line 59: ''principal component analysis (PCA)''.
    Current value is correct but capitalization differs from article (lower case in
    article). Minor style issue only.'
  source_passage: Line 59 (Methods section)

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields are identical between new and backup (only doi/published_year
    removed, abbreviations added). No content drift.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Abbreviation list is comprehensive and well-sourced, covering medical, statistical,
    and technical terms used in YAML values.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Comprehensive coverage of domain-specific abbreviations including USE, SST-2,
    LMRD, O-SCORE
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Proper 'Not defined in text' coding for abbreviations the article doesn't
    define
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Comprehensive abbreviation list covering all domains (medical, statistical,
    technical).
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of non-defined abbreviations like QA, WBA, RQ3, US,
    ID.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. Only doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added. No
    extraction content changes detected.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: RQ3 appears in multiple articles' F2 values as a project-level abbreviation.
    It is technically present in YAML values, so listing it is acceptable, though
    it is an extractor-introduced term. The ID issue is the clearest candidate for
    removal. Overall the abbreviation list is thorough and well-formatted.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. The O-SCORE abbreviation is correctly listed and the Modified
    O-SCORE is mentioned in the text without explicit expansion as Ottawa Surgical
    Competency Operating Room Evaluation.
