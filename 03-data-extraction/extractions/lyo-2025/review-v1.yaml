- item: D5c
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: Expert radiologists rated LLM-generated teaching points as relevant
    in 84.5% of cases...
  recommended_value: Clarify that this is expert evaluation of output quality/relevance
    rather than stakeholder acceptability of implementation
  rationale: The teaching point relevance ratings are from expert radiologists evaluating
    AI outputs in a research context, not stakeholders evaluating acceptability of
    AI-in-assessment implementation. This is a borderline D5c case. The coding is
    defensible as expert perception data, but the evidence is somewhat closer to D4
    (expert evaluation of output quality) than D5c (stakeholder acceptability). Maintaining
    current coding for pragmatic reasons since it does represent expert perception.

  current_value: '2024'
  recommended_value: 2024 (epub 2024-08-19; print publication in 2025 volume 38 issue
    2)
  rationale: The bibliography.json shows epub-date 2024-08-19 and volume 38 issue
    2 (2025). The extraction uses 2024 which aligns with the epub/online-first date.
    Adding a note clarifies the year assignment.

- item: D3b_reproducibility
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'Reproducibility tested via five repeated runs per report: discrepancy
    count ICC(2,1)=0.690 and coefficient of variation=0.35; maximal severity Fleiss''
    kappa=0.718 and weighted kappa=0.94.'
  recommended_value: 'Reproducibility tested via five repeated runs per report (600
    total samples): discrepancy count ICC(2,1)=0.690 and coefficient of variation=0.35;
    maximal severity Fleiss'' kappa=0.718 and weighted kappa=0.94.'
  rationale: Adding the total sample size for the reproducibility analysis (600 samples)
    provides useful context.

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D3b reproducibility is one of the strongest in the corpus: ICC(2,1)=0.690,
    CV=0.35, Fleiss kappa=0.718, weighted kappa=0.94'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping with dual datasets (synthetic + ReXVal) and multiple metrics is
    thorough
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2d data governance constraints correctly captured as contextual factor
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D_summary correctly identifies D3 reproducibility as primary evidence
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Excellent capture of the reproducibility metrics (ICC, CV, Fleiss' kappa,
    weighted kappa)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of both synthetic and ReXVal dataset results
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good identification of teaching-point relevance rating (84.5%) and correlation
    with severity
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct capture of the data governance constraint explanation
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: This is the only study in the corpus with formal quantitative reproducibility
    testing (D3b), making it particularly important for the review's D3 synthesis.
    Framework mapping is exemplary.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: One of the strongest extractions in the set. All statistics verified against
    fulltext. The D3 evidence is accurately captured, which is notable since many
    studies lack this evidence entirely.
