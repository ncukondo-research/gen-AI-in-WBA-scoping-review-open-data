issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'DIF: ''Not defined in text (likely: Differential item functioning)'''
  rationale: DIF appears in F2 field value. Other articles with DIF in F2 include
    it.
  source_passage: Not applicable - retracted
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'F1: ''Not defined in text (likely: F1 score)'''
  recommended_value: 'F1: ''Not defined in text (likely: F1 score)'''
  rationale: Already consistent. No change needed.
  source_passage: D4b uses F1
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'API: Not defined in text (likely: Application Programming Interface)'
  recommended_value: 'API: Not defined in text (likely: Application Programming Interface)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''GPT-4 Turbo API'' and ''OpenAI GPT4-1104-preview''
    (line 34) without spelling out API. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 34 of fulltext.md

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CoT: Chain of thought'
  recommended_value: 'CoT: Not defined in text (likely: Chain of thought)'
  rationale: The fulltext uses 'zero-shot CoT' (line 73) and 'chain-of-thought' in
    passing, but does not formally define 'CoT' as an abbreviation with parenthetical
    expansion. The abbreviation appears without explicit definition. However, the
    term 'thought generation/zero-shot CoT' at line 73 provides reasonable contextual
    definition.

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CV: Not defined in text (likely: Coefficient of variation)'
  recommended_value: 'CV: Not defined in text (likely: Coefficient of variation)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''coefficient of variance = 0.35'' (line
    187) but abbreviates it as CV only in the extraction. The extraction uses ''CV''
    but the fulltext spells it out without abbreviating. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 187 of fulltext.md

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'F1: Not defined in text (likely: F1 score)'
  recommended_value: 'F1: F1 score'
  rationale: The fulltext uses 'F1 score' explicitly in table headers (lines 144,
    146, 157). While no parenthetical definition is given, the term is used as its
    own definition. The 'Not defined in text' coding is defensible but 'F1 score'
    is directly used.
