issues:
- item: D3a_evidence_present
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Yes'
  recommended_value: 'Yes'
  rationale: D3a is Yes because D3f has empirical subgroup bias analyses. This is
    consistent with the codebook rule that D3a=Yes if any sub-item D3b-D3f has empirical
    evidence. Correctly coded.

- item: E3_funding_coi
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: 'Funding: Not reported. COI: Not reported.'
  rationale: Other files (e.g., Gin, Jarry-Trujillo) provide more structured formatting
    with separate Funding/COI lines. Standardize for synthesis consistency.

- item: D3f
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: Subgroup analyses compared AI-CCC relationships by gender, PGY, and
    word-count groups...
  recommended_value: 'Reclassify gender/PGY/word-count subgroup analyses: These are
    subgroup comparisons of D4 agreement metrics, not D3f bias/fairness analyses of
    AI outputs per se'
  rationale: 'The subgroup analyses in Partin compare the RELATIONSHIP between AI
    and CCC scores across gender/PGY/word-count groups (i.e., whether AI-CCC agreement
    differs by subgroup). This is not the same as D3f, which asks whether ''AI assessment
    outputs differ systematically across demographic groups'' (i.e., statistical bias
    in the AI outputs themselves). The study does not report whether AI milestone
    scores themselves were systematically higher or lower for one gender versus another
    independent of CCC scores. The analyses examine whether the AI-CCC CORRELATION
    varies by subgroup, which is more accurately a D4-level subgroup moderation analysis.
    Per Rule #11, statistical detection of bias in AI outputs belongs under D3f, but
    these analyses test for differential validity (D4 moderation), not differential
    AI output. This should be reclassified from D3f to D4 subgroup analysis, and D3a
    should be changed to No.'

- item: D3a
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: 'Yes'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: Consequent to the D3f reclassification above, D3a should be No since
    no other D3 sub-items have empirical evidence. The extraction currently codes
    D3a=Yes solely based on D3f, and if D3f is reclassified, D3a becomes No.

  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: '24'
  recommended_value: 24 residents
  rationale: Adding the unit for consistency with other extractions.

notes:

  text: B2 inferred as 'Web interface' from 'new chat in ChatGPT' description - flagged
    in F3b appropriately.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The D3f vs D4d boundary is the key issue. The Partin study subgroup analyses
    examine whether AI-CCC agreement varies by group (differential validity = D4),
    not whether AI scores are systematically biased by group independent of comparator
    (statistical bias = D3f). D_summary will need updating if D3 is reclassified.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Strong fidelity throughout. All statistics verified against fulltext. No fabricated
    data points detected.
