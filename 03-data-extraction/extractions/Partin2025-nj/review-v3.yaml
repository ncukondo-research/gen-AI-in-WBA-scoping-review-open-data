issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'PGY: ''postgraduate years'''
  recommended_value: 'PGY: ''postgraduate year'''
  rationale: Standard expansion is singular 'postgraduate year' (PGY-1 = postgraduate
    year 1). Minor style issue.
  source_passage: standard usage
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''artificial intelligence'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Artificial intelligence'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency
  source_passage: Multiple fields
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'PGY: ''postgraduate years'''
  recommended_value: 'PGY: ''Postgraduate year'''
  rationale: 'Cross-article consistency: singular form and capitalization'
  source_passage: A3b uses 'PGY-1 to PGY-3'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'LLM: ''Not defined in text (likely: Large language model)'''
  rationale: LLM appears in F2 field value.
  source_passage: Not applicable - retracted
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'WBA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Workplace-based assessment)'''
  rationale: 'WBA appears in F2 field value: ''text-only WBA inputs'''
  source_passage: 'F2: ''text-only WBA inputs'''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CARE: context, action, result, example'
  recommended_value: 'CARE: context, action, result, example'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext defines CARE as ''CARE (context, action, result,
    example) prompt engineering framework'' (line 45). Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 45 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'PGY: postgraduate years'
  recommended_value: 'PGY: postgraduate years'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext defines ''postgraduate years (PGY) 1 to 3''
    (line 43). Current coding is correct. Note: singular vs plural (''year'' vs ''years'')
    is a minor style difference.'
  source_passage: Line 43 of fulltext.md

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'PHI: Not defined in text (likely: Protected Health Information)'
  recommended_value: 'PHI: protected health information'
  rationale: 'The fulltext states ''no discoverable clinical scenarios or patient
    protected health information was included'' (line 43). While the abbreviation
    ''PHI'' itself is not used with parenthetical expansion, the full phrase appears.
    However, checking extraction: PHI appears in D2d field value. The fulltext uses
    the full phrase without abbreviating it. ''Not defined in text'' is defensible
    since the abbreviation PHI is never introduced with the parenthetical.'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CI: Not present in abbreviations list'
  recommended_value: Consider adding CI if it appears in field values
  rationale: 'Checking: the fulltext defines CI as ''confidence interval'' in table
    abbreviations (line 104). CI appears in extraction field D4b (''95% CI''). However,
    looking again at the abbreviations list - CI is not listed. This should be added
    since it appears in field values.'
  source_passage: Line 104 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (not listed)
  recommended_value: 'CI: confidence interval'
  rationale: CI appears in the D4b field value and is defined in the fulltext table
    abbreviations (line 104). Should be added.
  source_passage: Line 104 of fulltext.md; D4b field value
