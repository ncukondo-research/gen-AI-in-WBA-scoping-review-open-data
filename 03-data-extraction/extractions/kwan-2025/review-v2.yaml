issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'US: ''Not defined in text (likely: United States)'''
  recommended_value: (remove entry)
  rationale: US does not appear in YAML field values for this Canadian study.
  source_passage: Scanned all field values
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: major
  type: remove
  current_value: 'US: ''Not defined in text (likely: United States)'''
  recommended_value: (remove)
  rationale: 'US does not appear in any YAML field value. The study is set in Canada.
    Scanning all fields: not found.'
  source_passage: No field value contains 'US'
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''artificial intelligence'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Artificial intelligence'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency
  source_passage: Multiple fields use 'AI'
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'EPA: ''entrustable professional activities'''
  recommended_value: 'EPA: ''Entrustable Professional Activities'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency in capitalization
  source_passage: Multiple fields use 'EPA'

  current_value: 'GPT: ''generative pre-trained transformer'''
  recommended_value: 'GPT: ''Generative pre-trained transformer'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency
  source_passage: Multiple fields
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CoT: Not defined in text (likely: Chain-of-Thought)'
  recommended_value: 'CoT: Not defined in text (likely: Chain-of-Thought)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''Chain-of-Thought'' as a section heading
    and in text (line 105, 145, 165) but does not use the abbreviation ''CoT''. The
    abbreviation appears in the extraction field values (B3b, D2b). Since ''CoT''
    is used in extraction but not defined with that abbreviation in the article, the
    ''Not defined in text'' coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Lines 105, 145, 165 of fulltext.md

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'US: Not defined in text (likely: United States)'
  recommended_value: (remove US entirely or verify it appears in field values)
  rationale: 'Checking extraction field values: US appears in E1 cost context (''$76.83
    US'', ''$3,700 US'') - this is a currency denominator from the fulltext, not an
    abbreviation per se. However, it is borderline. If ''US'' does not appear in any
    extraction field value, it should be removed.'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'GPT: generative pre-trained transformer'
  recommended_value: 'GPT: generative pre-trained transformer'
  rationale: 'Checking fulltext: GPT is used extensively but the definition ''generative
    pre-trained transformer'' is not spelled out in the Kwan fulltext. This may need
    ''Not defined in text'' coding. However, GPT as a well-known product name may
    not require explicit article definition. Minor style issue.'
  source_passage: Not found spelled out in fulltext

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields identical to backup. No content changes.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Good abbreviation coverage including QuAL, CBME, EPA, CoT, F1, GPT.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good inclusion of QuAL and F1 definitions
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean, well-organized abbreviation section
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate definitions for QuAL (Quality of Assessment for Learning), CBME,
    EPA, F1.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: API correctly defined as 'application programming interface' matching fulltext
    line 85.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good coverage of all field-value abbreviations.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added. One minor
    over-inclusion.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: The spurious 'US' entry is the main issue. This study is Canadian and US does
    not appear in field values.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. US and GPT definition sourcing are minor points.
- reviewer: team-lead
  text: 'Lightweight post-fix review: Removed spurious US entry not in YAML values.
    Fixes verified, validate_yaml.py passes. Approved.'
