  current_value: Kwan-2025
  recommended_value: Kwan-2025
  rationale: Title case, consistent with most other files. No change needed.

- item: D2b_reasoning_transparency
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: CoT prompting techniques used but reasoning quality not independently
    examined.
  recommended_value: CoT prompting techniques used but reasoning quality not independently
    examined.
  rationale: Uses the exact codebook-specified phrase. Consistent with bany_abdelnabi-2025.
    Good.

  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'Confirm No: multiple prompting techniques and fine-tuning were
    compared, but this represents D4 optimization, not D3 internal structure'
  rationale: 'The study compares multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, modified,
    task decomposition, CoT) and fine-tuning. This could be interpreted as examining
    model parameter/configuration effects on outputs. However, per Rule #6, comparing
    model configurations without reporting quantitative reproducibility/reliability
    metrics does not meet D3 threshold. The comparison of F1 scores across techniques
    is a D4 accuracy optimization exercise, not a D3 internal structure analysis.
    Current coding is correct.'

- item: D2b
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: CoT prompting techniques used but reasoning quality not independently
    examined.
  recommended_value: Current coding is correct per codebook D2b note
  rationale: CoT was used as a prompting strategy but reasoning quality was evaluated
    only via classification accuracy (F1), not independent examination of the reasoning
    process itself. Correctly coded.

- item: D4b_ai_human_agreement
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'AI outputs were evaluated against human-rated QuAL ground truth
    using F1. Best reported results: fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Evidence 0.827, Suggestion
    0.949, Connection 0.933; GPT-4 best Suggestion 0.902 and Connection 0.882, lower
    Evidence performance (up to 0.554 with modified prompt).'
  recommended_value: 'AI outputs were evaluated against human-rated QuAL ground truth
    using F1. Best reported results: fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Evidence 0.827, Suggestion
    0.949, Connection 0.933 (holdout test set); GPT-4 best Suggestion 0.902 (baseline)
    and Connection 0.882 (modified prompt), Evidence up to 0.554 (modified prompt).
    All non-fine-tuned results on training set.'
  rationale: The extraction should clarify that fine-tuned results were on the holdout
    test set while prompt engineering results were on the training set, as this distinction
    matters for interpretation.

    evaluation on the test dataset were performed.'' Table 2 caption.'

  type: rephrase
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: Not reported (first-year residents in general surgery, orthopedic
    surgery, urology, and obstetrics/gynecology at Queen's University 2017-2022; exact
    number of residents not stated)
  rationale: Adding the contextual detail that the program includes multiple surgical
    specialties' first-year residents, even though the exact count is not given.

- item: D3a_evidence_present
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: Confirming this is correct. While multiple prompt strategies are compared,
    these are model-optimization experiments, not reproducibility/reliability metrics
    as defined by the codebook D3 threshold. The coding is accurate.

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D2b uses exact codebook phrase for CoT-without-evaluation scenario.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: B8 correctly captures both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good specificity in D4b with per-dimension F1 scores.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping correctly uses F1 as the primary metric and reports per-dimension
    performance
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 mapping with QuAL rubric alignment and expert-constructed ground truth
    is well done
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2d privacy handling (OpenAI API enterprise policy, data not retained) correctly
    captured
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of all F1 scores from Table 2
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the fine-tuning hyperparameters (learning rate 2, batch size
    2, epochs 3)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification that prompts are in appendices not fully available
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate flagging of confidence as Medium due to appendix dependency
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean, well-structured extraction. One of the few studies with fine-tuning.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Appendix access limitations are appropriately flagged in F3b. Overall framework
    mapping is sound.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: The extraction references prompt details in appendices that were not available
    in the fulltext file, which is appropriately noted. No hallucinated statistics
    found.
