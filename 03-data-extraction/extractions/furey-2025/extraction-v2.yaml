  B3a_prompt_reported: Yes (full text provided)
  B3b_engineering_techniques: 'Direct instruction rewrite prompt: ''rewrite using growth mindset language:'' followed by the original statement'
  B3c_prompt_iteration: 'Yes: more complex statements were slightly altered for AI integration/uniformity; outputs were post-processed and 10 AI outputs excluded for context/content drift'
B4_ai_role: Mindset language transformation
B5_input_data: Narrative feedback / free-text comments
B6_output_data: Written feedback text
B7_comparator: 'Expert human raters (number: 2) trained in growth mindset language; adjudication by original coder'

C1_wba_tools: 'Narrative feedback forms (general / institution-specific); Other: SIMPL inguinal hernia evaluation feedback statements'
C2_assessment_context: Formative and summative written feedback statements for surgery clerkship students and surgical residents (including national SIMPL operative evaluation feedback), analyzed after
  AI rewriting of fixed-mindset statements.
D1_content:
  D1a_evidence_present: 'Yes'
  D1b_prompt_rubric_alignment: Prompt explicitly targeted growth mindset transformation; original coder used a pre-developed growth vs fixed language codebook to classify statements and assess transformed
    outputs.
  D1c_content_coverage: Coverage of intended construct (GML vs FML) was evaluated via blinded coding of statement type; AI outputs that altered context/content were identified and excluded (10 statements).
  D1d_expert_review: Two blinded surgical resident reviewers trained in GML concepts reviewed statements; disagreements were adjudicated by the original coder.
D2_response_process:
  D2a_evidence_present: 'Yes'
  D2b_reasoning_transparency: No evidence reported
  D2c_hallucination_assessment: 'Yes: authors reported AI context/content fabrication; 10 of 42 AI-generated outputs were excluded because content/context changed and could add untrue information.'
  D2d_data_security: Deidentified feedback statements were used; study was deemed nonhuman-subject research and institutional review board-exempt.
  D2e_quality_assurance: 'Manual quality assurance steps were described: problematic AI terms (''presenter''/''presentation'') were edited before review, and substantially altered AI outputs were excluded
    from the final dataset.'

D4_relationship_to_other_variables:
  D4a_evidence_present: 'Yes'
  D4b_ai_human_agreement: Human reviewers agreed 17/18 (94.4%) AI-modified FML->GML statements were GML; original GML agreement 37/41 (90.2%); original FML agreement 26/26 (100%); AI-assisted FML-to-FML
    13/14 (92.9%). For AI-use detection, agreement was 18/32 (56.3%) for AI-modified statements and 30/67 (44.8%) for originals; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%.
  D4c_human_raters: Two blinded surgical resident reviewers trained in GML concepts; original coder adjudicated disagreements.

D_summary: 'Primary: D4 (comparison of AI-transformed statements with blinded human ratings, with agreement/sensitivity/specificity metrics).

  Secondary: D1 (construct-aligned prompting and expert content review), D2 (hallucination/context-drift observations, deidentification, quality assurance filtering/editing).

  Absent: D3 (no reproducibility/reliability/internal psychometric or fairness analyses), D5 (no empirical learner-impact or stakeholder-acceptability outcomes).

  '
E1_limitations: '- AI sometimes failed to preserve context, introducing terms like "presenter/presentation."

  - Ten AI-generated statements were excluded because AI changed both context and content (possible fabrication risk).

  - AI may not reliably infer learner level (student vs resident/fellow) without explicit prompt context.

  - Authors note AI cannot replace formal faculty training in growth mindset concepts.

  '
E2_future_research: '- Include clearer contextual details in prompts to improve output fidelity.

  - Continue human review of AI-generated feedback before verbatim use.

  - Study faculty utilization rates and recipient impact of AI-enhanced feedback.

  - Conduct further quantitative and qualitative studies on AI to enhance feedback processes.

  conflict of interest/Disclosure: One author (Dr. Hoffman) is an Associate Editor for the journal and was recused from peer review/editorial decisions; editor recusal also noted for institutional conflict.

  AI declaration: Google Chrome "Help me write" was used in study methodology, not for manuscript writing; authors reviewed/edited outputs and took responsibility.

F1_key_findings_summary: 'This qualitative proof-of-concept study found that Google Chrome "Help me write" could transform fixed mindset feedback into growth mindset language, with blinded reviewers classifying
  17/18 (94.4%) AI-modified FML->GML statements as GML. Reviewers had limited ability to detect AI authorship (56.3% agreement on AI-modified items; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%), suggesting AI-written
  feedback often appeared human-like. The study also identified fidelity risks: some AI outputs altered context/content, leading to exclusion of 10 generated statements. Authors conclude AI may be a useful
  adjunct for faculty feedback writing but not a substitute for faculty development in growth mindset principles.

  '
F2_rq3_relevance: '- Demonstrates a generative-AI-specific workflow for linguistic transformation of feedback (fixed-to-growth mindset), which is distinct from conventional scoring/classification applications.

  - Highlights prompt sensitivity/context dependence: insufficient context can cause semantic drift and fabricated additions, requiring human quality assurance before use.

  - Exposes evidence gaps under Downing domains: no internal-structure psychometrics (reproducibility, parameter effects, fairness) and no empirical consequential validity (learner outcomes/acceptability).

  - Suggests implementation challenge of balancing AI efficiency with educator oversight and mindset training.

F3_confidence:
  F3a_overall: 'Medium: Most fields are directly reported, but country provenance for all records and boundary between document counts (83 source vs 99 finalized) require cautious interpretation.'
  F3b_items_for_verification: '- A3_country: Country of all data sources was not explicitly stated despite U.S.-based affiliations/context.

    - A5d_num_documents: Both 83 original and 99 finalized statements are reported; confirm preferred extraction convention.

    - D2c_hallucination_assessment: Fabrication/context drift is explicit, but term "hallucination" is partly discussed as limitation; mapping should be verified for consistency.

    - D4b_ai_human_agreement: Metrics are agreement against intended/coded statement categories rather than classic AI-vs-expert scoring in WBA.

    - Human verification (2026-02-18): A3 retained as ''Unclear'' (United States highly likely from affiliations/Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education context but not explicitly stated).
    D4b corrected to include AI-assisted FML-to-FML 13/14 (92.9%) from Table 1.
