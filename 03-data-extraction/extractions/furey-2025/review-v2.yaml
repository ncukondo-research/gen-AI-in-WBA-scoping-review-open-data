  recommended_value: 'LLM: ''Not defined in text (likely: Large language model)'''
  rationale: 'LLM appears in F2 field value (''no internal-structure psychometrics
    (reproducibility, parameter effects, fairness) and no empirical consequential
    validity (learner outcomes/acceptability)'') - actually checking again: F2 doesn''t
    use LLM. Checking E2: ''LLM feedback'' - no. Checking E1: no. Checking F1: no.

  current_value: 'AAS: Not defined in text (likely: Association for Academic Surgery)'
  recommended_value: (remove AAS entirely or verify it appears in field values)
  rationale: AAS does not appear in any extraction field value. It appears only in
    the meeting-presentation section of the fulltext and possibly in F3b. Per codebook
    rule, only abbreviations appearing in field values should be listed.

  recommended_value: (remove ASC entirely or verify it appears in field values)
  rationale: ASC does not appear in any extraction field value. It appears only in
    the meeting-presentation disclosure. Per codebook rule, only abbreviations from
    field values should be listed.

  current_value: 'DO: Not defined in text (likely: Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine)'

  current_value: 'SIMPL: System for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning Operating
    Room system'
  recommended_value: 'SIMPL: Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning'
  rationale: The fulltext defines SIMPL in the Acknowledgments as 'Society for Improving
    Medical Professional Learning (SIMPL)' (line 161). The current definition 'System
    for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning Operating Room system' appears
    to be a fabricated conflation. The SIMPL website and the fulltext both use 'Society
    for Improving Medical Professional Learning'.

- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Core abbreviations (FML, FSs, GML, SIMPL, ACGME, IRB) are correctly identified.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good study-specific abbreviations (FML, FSs, GML, SIMPL)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct definitions for FML, FSs, GML as defined in the article.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate coding for IRB as not defined in text.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'Multiple abbreviations appear to have been extracted from the article text/metadata
    rather than from YAML field values. These are minor issues (not hallucinated definitions,
    just over-inclusion) but should be trimmed per codebook rule 12: ''Only list abbreviations
    that actually appear in the values of the current extraction.'' Verdict remains
    approve because these are all minor severity.'
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: 'This article has the most spurious entries of any file (7 abbreviations not
    found in any field value: AAS, ASC, DO, ML, MS, NV, PM). These appear to have
    been extracted from the article''s author credential lines or conference metadata
    rather than from YAML field values. Requires revision to remove all 7.'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'One major issue: SIMPL definition is incorrect. Several minor issues involve
    abbreviations listed that do not appear in extraction field values (AAS, ASC,
    DO, ML, MS, NV, PM). These should be removed per codebook rule #12.'
- reviewer: team-lead
  text: 'Lightweight post-fix review: Removed 7 spurious abbreviation entries not
    in YAML values; corrected SIMPL definition to match fulltext. Fixes verified,
    validate_yaml.py passes. Approved.'
