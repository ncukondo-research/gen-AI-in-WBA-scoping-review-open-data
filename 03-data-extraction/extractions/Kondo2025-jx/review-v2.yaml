- item: D3a
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Unclear: preliminary inter-model comparison was described, but no
    quantitative reproducibility/inter-model agreement metrics were reported.'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: 'The R1 review flagged D3a as borderline. After verifying the fulltext
    (line 165), the model comparison is described as: ''Trial prompts and randomly
    selected student records were entered into each web platform, and the extracted
    results were compared in terms of validity. Validity was evaluated from the perspective
    of whether the output followed the expected format, whether the output matched
    the experience items expected from the text, and whether the output was reproducible.
    ChatGPT by OpenAI produced the most valid outputs, so it was selected for this
    study.'' No quantitative inter-model metrics (kappa, ICC, percentage agreement
    between models) are reported. Per codebook Rule #6, mentioning reproducibility
    as a model selection criterion without reporting quantitative metrics does NOT
    meet the threshold. D3a should be ''No'' rather than ''Unclear''. The current
    ''Unclear'' coding is conservative but inconsistent with the strict codebook threshold
    rule applied to other articles (e.g., atsukawa-2025 D3a=No). For cross-study consistency,
    recommend changing to ''No''.'

- item: D3a
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Unclear: preliminary inter-model comparison was described, but no
    quantitative reproducibility/inter-model agreement metrics were reported.'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: 'Per codebook Rule #6, mentioning reproducibility as a model selection
    criterion without quantitative metrics does not meet threshold. The fulltext (Methods,
    line 165) states ''extracted results were compared in terms of validity'' across
    ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude but provides no quantitative inter-model metrics.
    Coding as ''Unclear'' is defensible but ''No'' would be more consistent with the
    codebook threshold rule and with D3b-D3f all being ''No evidence reported''. The
    D_summary already acknowledges this ambiguity. Not a major issue because the current
    coding errs on the side of transparency.'

- item: D3a_evidence_present
  severity: major
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Unclear: preliminary inter-model comparison was described, but no
    quantitative reproducibility/inter-model agreement metrics were reported.'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: All 8 approved extraction-final.yaml files use either 'Yes' or 'No' for
    D3a_evidence_present. None uses 'Unclear:...' The codebook specifies D3a should
    be 'Yes' if any sub-item D3b-D3f has empirical evidence, 'No' otherwise. Since
    D3b-D3f are all 'No evidence reported', D3a must be 'No'. The qualifier about
    the preliminary model comparison is already well-captured in D_summary and F2_rq3_relevance.
    Move any clarifying note about the qualitative model comparison to F3b_items_for_verification
    or F2.

- item: D_summary
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Primary: D4 (...). Secondary: D1 (...), D2 (...). D3 status: Unclear
    at source level because preliminary inter-model comparison was described qualitatively,
    but no quantitative reproducibility/internal-structure metrics (including bias/fairness
    analysis) were reported. Absent: D5 (...)'
  recommended_value: 'Primary: D4 (agreement/association with student-corrected reference
    using kappa, Jaccard, sensitivity/specificity). Secondary: D1 (MCC template alignment
    and domain coverage), D2 (indirect false-positive proxy, anonymization/privacy
    handling, quality checks). Absent: D3 (no quantitative reproducibility/internal-structure
    metrics reported), D5 (no empirical impact/acceptability/consequences data).'
  rationale: 'Consequent to D3a change: D_summary should use ''Absent: D3'' consistently
    with other approved finals (e.g., Gin-2024, Jarry-Trujillo-2024, furey-2025) rather
    than the special ''D3 status: Unclear'' phrasing. The qualifier about the qualitative
    model comparison can be kept parenthetically.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D3a was updated from v1 'No' to v2 'Unclear' based on R1 reviewer feedback,
    which was a reasonable interim response. The issue now is consistency across the
    corpus.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: B1_ai_models correctly rephrased to emphasize GPT-4 Turbo as primary model
    per R1 feedback.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: B4_ai_role correctly simplified to 'Clinical experience tracking' per R1 feedback.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D2c indirect false-positive proxy coding is consistent with codebook Rule
    #8.'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D_summary correctly reflects the Unclear D3 status.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Round 1 issues (B1 rephrase, B4 restriction to 'Clinical experience tracking',
    D3a reconsideration) were all properly addressed in v2.

  text: F3b clearly documents which R1 issues were addressed and how.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The only remaining issue is the D3a 'Unclear' vs 'No' coding. This is a minor
    consistency issue rather than a major framework misclassification. If the team
    decides 'Unclear' is acceptable as a conservative coding, this is defensible but
    creates an inconsistency with atsukawa-2025 which has a similar situation (qualitative
    model comparison without quantitative metrics) coded as D3a=No. Recommend standardizing
    both to 'No' with the qualitative mention noted in F2.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Clean extraction. The D3a 'Unclear' vs 'No' distinction is the only remaining
    debatable point, but it is a minor stylistic/threshold judgment rather than a
    factual error.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: The D3a issue is the sole remaining inconsistency with the approved corpus.
    All other aspects are well-aligned.
