  current_value: 'CI: Not defined in text (likely: Confidence interval)'
  recommended_value: 'CI: Not defined in text (likely: Confidence interval)'
  rationale: 'CI appears in extraction field values (D4b: ''95% CI''). Checking fulltext:
    CI is used in the article but may not be explicitly defined with parenthetical
    expansion. Current coding appears correct.'

- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'MCC: Model Core Curriculum for Medical Education'
  recommended_value: 'MCC: Model Core Curriculum for Medical Education'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext defines MCC as related to Model Core Curriculum
    (lines 47, 51, 65). The exact phrase ''Model Core Curriculum for Medical Education''
    may be slightly expanded from the article''s usage, but is accurate.'
