issues:
- item: B4_ai_role
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: Clinical experience tracking; Competency mapping / milestone assignment
  recommended_value: Clinical experience tracking
  rationale: The study primarily extracts experienced items from logs; 'Competency
    mapping / milestone assignment' may overstate the role since no actual milestone/competency
    levels are assigned. However, mapping experiences to MCC goals could be considered
    competency mapping. Borderline - keep current coding but flag for team discussion.

- item: D3a
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'Unclear: verify whether preliminary model comparison constitutes
    inter-model agreement evidence'
  rationale: 'The extraction states D3a=No, but the fulltext describes preliminary
    comparison of GPT-4-turbo, Gemini, and Claude on trial prompts before selecting
    GPT-4-turbo as the final model. Per Rule #6, mentioning reproducibility as a model
    selection criterion without reporting quantitative metrics does NOT meet the threshold.
    However, the codebook D3c definition asks whether ''different AI models were compared
    on the same data'' and requests ''which models and agreement metrics.'' If any
    quantitative comparison metrics exist in the fulltext for the model selection
    phase, this could qualify as D3c. The fulltext states models were compared but
    does not report specific inter-model metrics. Current coding as No is likely correct,
    but should be verified against the full article to ensure no quantitative comparison
    data was missed.'

- item: B1_ai_models
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: ChatGPT (OpenAI; GPT-4-turbo, gpt-4-0125-preview); Gemini (version
    not specified, preliminary comparison); Claude (version not specified, preliminary
    comparison)
  recommended_value: GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-0125-preview, OpenAI); Gemini (version not
    specified, preliminary comparison only); Claude (version not specified, preliminary
    comparison only)
  rationale: 'Minor: the primary model used was GPT-4-turbo; Gemini and Claude were
    only used in preliminary comparison and not for the main analysis. Clarifying
    this distinction improves accuracy.'

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present and correctly structured.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D sub-items correctly use 'No evidence reported'.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D4c appropriately flags comparator weakness (student self-report).
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Good specificity in D4b metrics (Jaccard, kappa, sensitivity, specificity
    with CIs).
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D4c correctly flags comparator as weaker because ground truth is student
    self-report per Rule #9'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D2c correctly coded as indirect via false-positive proxy per Rule #8'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 mapping for MCC template alignment is appropriate
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of all quantitative metrics (Jaccard 0.59, kappa 0.65,
    sensitivity 62.39%, specificity 99.34%)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification that the comparator was student self-report (weaker
    ground truth)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the three patterns of missed items in findings
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D2c indirect hallucination proxy coding is consistent with other files. Clean
    structure overall.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The major issue is borderline. If no quantitative inter-model metrics exist
    in the fulltext, D3a=No is correct and this becomes a minor clarification. Recommend
    verification.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: The extraction accurately reflects the fulltext. No hallucinated data points
    identified.
