- item: A1_doi
  severity: minor
  type: verify
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: Verify DOI availability
  rationale: F3b correctly flags this for verification. All other files have DOIs.
    If the article is published, DOI should be obtainable from bibliography.json.

- item: D2b_reasoning_transparency
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Unclear: Authors report ChatGPT outputs included reasoning and references
    to feedback text, but reasoning quality was not independently and systematically
    evaluated.'
  recommended_value: 'Unclear: Authors report ChatGPT outputs included reasoning and
    references to feedback text, but reasoning quality was not independently and systematically
    evaluated.'
  rationale: This is a valid and well-reasoned 'Unclear' coding. Other files with
    similar situations use slightly different phrasing. The Atsukawa file says 'LLM
    outputs included a brief rationale for each criterion; however, reasoning quality
    was not independently evaluated.' Consider standardizing the phrasing pattern.

  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Custom training: ChatGPT Explore instance configured with instructions

    text'
  recommended_value: 'Custom training: ChatGPT Explore instance configured with instructions
    plus uploaded training document containing 30 example entries and justification
    text'
  rationale: Correctly coded. The Explore/Knowledge upload is distinct from API fine-tuning
    but represents meaningful customization. Flagged in F3c appropriately.

- item: D2c
  severity: major
  type: missing_evidence
  current_value: No evidence reported
  recommended_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy)'
  rationale: 'The study reports 90% concordance with 10% discordance between ChatGPT
    and faculty on the 60-entry reference set. The supplementary review showed 92%
    concordance with 8% discordance. These discordant classifications represent AI
    outputs not matching expert ground truth, which per Rule #8 should be coded as
    indirect false-positive analysis as proxy for hallucination. Additionally, the
    authors explicitly note ChatGPT ''may overestimate some domains (notably PBL),
    requiring human oversight,'' which describes content fabrication/over-attribution.
    This should be coded consistently with other studies where discordant classifications
    were coded as D2c evidence.'
  source_passage: fulltext Results section (90% concordance); fulltext Discussion
    (PBL overestimation)
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: A1_doi
  severity: major
  type: correct_value
  current_value: Not reported
  recommended_value: 10.1002/lary.32368
  rationale: The DOI is available in the bibliography.json file for this article and
    is a standard published article identifier. While the fulltext PDF rendering may
    not display the DOI prominently, the bibliography metadata clearly provides it.
    The extraction should use available metadata.

- item: D4b_ai_human_agreement
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: AI-human agreement was directly assessed on 60 entries with concordance
    rate 90% and Cohen's kappa = 0.941. Supplementary subset review showed concordance
    rate 92% with kappa = 0.82 for selected discrepant domains.
  recommended_value: AI-human agreement was directly assessed on 60 entries with concordance
    rate 90% and Cohen's kappa = 0.94. Supplementary subset review showed concordance
    rate 92% with kappa = 0.82 for selected discrepant domains.
  rationale: The fulltext reports kappa = 0.94, not 0.941. The third decimal place
    appears to be fabricated precision not present in the source.
  source_passage: 'Abstract and Results: ''ChatGPT evaluated entries with 90% concordance
    with faculty (kappa = 0.94)'''

commendations:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: All required YAML fields present.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Thorough D4 evidence with both primary and supplementary concordance metrics.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D2e quality assurance section is detailed and well-structured.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping is excellent with strong kappa values clearly reported
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 prompt-rubric alignment well documented (same prompt as faculty; ACGME
    competency definitions)
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2e QA procedures thoroughly captured (session resets, memory clearing, supplementary
    blinded review)
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4e cross-tool comparison coding is reasonable
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Accurate extraction of the multi-format comparison (SIMPL-OR, OSATS, EOR)
    with correct statistics
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Good capture of the custom GPT workflow (Explore feature, Knowledge upload,
    session resets)
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct identification of the QA procedures including session memory management
notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: The DOI absence is unusual and should be verified. Overall well-structured
    extraction.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'The D2c issue affects consistency across the corpus. Multiple other studies
    with similar discordance rates are coded as D2c=Yes (indirect), so ahmad-2025
    should be treated consistently per Rule #8.'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: The DOI issue is the only major fidelity concern. All other statistics and
    claims verified against fulltext.
