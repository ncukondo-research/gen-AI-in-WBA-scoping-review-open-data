  current_value: 'SIMPL-OR: ''society for improving medical professional learning
    of operating room performance'''
  recommended_value: 'SIMPL-OR: ''Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning
    of Operating Room performance'''
  rationale: Proper noun should be capitalized
  source_passage: C1 uses 'SIMPL-OR'
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'WBA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Workplace-based assessment)'''
  rationale: 'WBA appears in F2 field value: ''WBA-AI studies'''
  source_passage: 'F2: ''WBA-AI studies'''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Artificial intelligence)'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency capitalization
  source_passage: Multiple fields

- item: abbreviations
  severity: major
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'SIMPL-OR: society for improving medical professional learning of
    operating room performance'
  recommended_value: 'SIMPL-OR: Not defined in text (likely: System for Improving
    and Measuring Procedural Learning - Operating Room)'
  rationale: The fulltext does NOT define SIMPL-OR explicitly. It uses 'SIMPL-OR'
    throughout but never provides a parenthetical expansion. The definition given
    ('society for improving medical professional learning of operating room performance')
    appears fabricated. SIMPL is actually 'Society for Improving Medical Professional
    Learning' (the organization), and SIMPL-OR is their operating room assessment
    app. The extraction's current definition incorrectly conflates the organization
    name with 'operating room performance'. Since the article doesn't define it, it
    should be coded as 'Not defined in text'.
  source_passage: Lines 27, 31, 57, 61, 71 of fulltext.md (used without definition)
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'AI: Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'
  recommended_value: 'AI: Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext does not explicitly define AI with parenthetical
    expansion in the main body. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'NIH: Not defined in text (likely: National Institutes of Health)'
  recommended_value: (remove NIH entirely or verify it appears in field values)
  rationale: NIH appears only in E3_funding_coi as 'NIH/National Institute of Health
    grant'. Since it appears in a field value, it should remain. However the fulltext
    says 'NIH/National Institute of Health' (line from E3 field) - if this is from
    the fulltext, it's defined there.
  source_passage: E3 field value
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'NEJM: New England Journal of Medicine'
  recommended_value: 'NEJM: New England Journal of Medicine'
  rationale: 'Checking: NEJM appears in D1b field value (''adapted from NEJM language'').
    The fulltext mentions it at line 75. Current coding appears correct.'
  source_passage: Line 75 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'PBL: practice-based learning'
  recommended_value: 'PBL: Not defined in text (likely: practice-based learning)'
  rationale: 'Checking the fulltext: PBL appears in tables (lines 106, 116) without
    explicit parenthetical definition. The tables use ''PBL'' as a label. The full
    form is not given with the abbreviation.'
  source_passage: Lines 106, 116 of fulltext.md
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (not listed)
  recommended_value: 'IRB: Institutional Review Board'
  rationale: IRB appears in D2d field value ('IRB00358100'). The fulltext defines
    it at line 67 as 'Institutional Review Board'. Should be added.
  source_passage: Line 67 of fulltext.md
