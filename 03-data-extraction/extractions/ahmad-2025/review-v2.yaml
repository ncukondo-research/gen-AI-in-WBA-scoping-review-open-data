issues:
- item: D1d/D4b kappa inconsistency
  severity: minor
  type: internal_inconsistency
  current_value: D1d says 'kappa 0.941'; D4b says 'Cohen's kappa = 0.94'
  recommended_value: Use consistent value. The fulltext Abstract says kappa = 0.94
    (line 31), while the Results section says kappa = 0.941 (line 91). Either value
    is defensible, but they should match within the extraction.
  rationale: The Round 1 review recommended changing 0.941 to 0.94 (calling 0.941
    'fabricated precision'). However, the fulltext Results section does report 0.941
    verbatim. The v2 extraction changed D4b to 0.94 but left D1d as 0.941. Both values
    appear in the source text, so neither is fabricated, but the extraction should
    use a consistent value. Recommend standardizing to 0.94 (Abstract value) throughout,
    with a note in F3b that Results reports 0.941.
  source_passage: 'Abstract (line 31): ''kappa = 0.94''; Results (line 91): ''kappa
    = 0.941'''

- item: D2c_hallucination_assessment
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy).'
  recommended_value: 'Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy): 10% discordance
    between ChatGPT and faculty on 60-entry reference set (kappa 0.94); supplementary
    subset showed 8% discordance (kappa 0.82).'
  rationale: 'Other approved finals with indirect D2c coding include brief quantitative
    details after the proxy label (e.g., Lyo-2025: ''false positives (mean 3.3) and
    false negatives (mean 12)''; Bala-2025: ''24 model-predicted missed diagnoses
    were generated, 19 accepted as correct''). Adding the concordance/discordance
    metrics would improve cross-study synthesis consistency. However, this is a minor
    stylistic point and the current coding is technically correct.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D2c correctly changed from ''No evidence reported'' to ''Yes (indirect: false-positive
    analysis as proxy)'' per R1 framework-reviewer recommendation. The 10% discordance
    rate (90% concordance on 60 entries) and the authors'' explicit note about ChatGPT
    overestimating PBL domain both qualify as indirect false-positive evidence per
    codebook Rule #8. This is now consistent with coding applied to other studies
    (e.g., Kondo2025-jx, atsukawa-2025) where discordant classifications are coded
    as D2c indirect evidence.'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: A1_doi correctly set to '10.1002/lary.32368' per R1 fidelity-reviewer recommendation,
    sourced from bibliography metadata.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4b kappa correctly reported as 0.94 (not 0.941) per R1 fidelity-reviewer
    correction. The fulltext abstract states 'kappa = 0.94' without a third decimal
    place.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D_summary appropriately includes D2 as secondary evidence, consistent with
    the D2c upgrade.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 mapping remains strong with prompt-rubric alignment and competency coverage
    well documented.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D2e quality assurance procedures thoroughly captured (session resets, memory
    clearing, supplementary blinded review).
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Round 1 major issues addressed: A1_doi now correctly set to ''10.1002/lary.32368''
    (sourced from bibliography metadata, as fulltext PDF did not display DOI). D2c
    reclassified from ''No evidence reported'' to ''Yes (indirect: false-positive
    analysis as proxy)'' per Rule #8.'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Round 1 minor issue partially addressed: D4b kappa changed to 0.94 (but D1d
    still has 0.941 creating minor inconsistency).'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Primary concordance metrics verified: 90% concordance rate, kappa 0.94/0.941
    for 60-entry reference set (both values present in fulltext).'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer

  text: 'All R1 issues fully addressed: A1_doi corrected to 10.1002/lary.32368, D2c
    coded as ''Yes (indirect)'', D4b kappa corrected to 0.94.'
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D_summary format matches approved finals.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: B8_model_customization correctly and clearly coded for the ChatGPT Explore
    workflow.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: D2e quality assurance section is notably thorough with session resets, memory
    clearing, supplementary blinded review.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: YAML structure passes validation.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: F3c appropriately retains D2b, B8, and D4e as uncertain flags.
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All R1 major issues (A1_doi and D2c) have been correctly addressed. The D2c
    change brings this extraction into consistency with the rest of the corpus. F3b
    revision note accurately documents the changes made.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Strong revision. All major Round 1 issues resolved. The only remaining issue
    is the minor D1d/D4b kappa value inconsistency (0.941 vs 0.94), both of which
    appear in the source text.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Strong extraction. The only minor point is the D2c detail level, which is
    a stylistic preference rather than an error.
