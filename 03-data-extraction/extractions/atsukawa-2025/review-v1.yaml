    references...
  rationale: F3c correctly flags uncertainty about whether this constitutes inter-model
    agreement (D3c) vs model selection. The comparison uses model-vs-human metrics
    rather than direct model-model agreement. Current coding is reasonable but the
    boundary is interpretive.

  current_value: Model-selection QA included repeated runs (three times per model
    with majority answer used) and independent dual-radiologist review for comparison.
  recommended_value: Model-selection QA included repeated runs (three times per model
    with majority answer used) and independent dual-radiologist review for comparison.
  rationale: The triple-run majority-vote approach is notable. Per codebook D3b threshold,
    this could arguably be reproducibility evidence, but the codebook requires 'quantitative
    metrics (ICC, kappa, percentage agreement, CV)' which are not separately reported
    for the repeated runs. Current placement under D2e (QA) rather than D3b is correct
    per the threshold rule.

- item: D3c
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: Three LLMs compared on same 100-report set using quantitative performance
    against human references
  recommended_value: No evidence reported (reclassify to D4 comparative evidence)
  rationale: 'The D3c definition asks about inter-model agreement: ''Were different
    AI models compared on the same data? Report which models and agreement metrics.''
    The Atsukawa study compared three models'' AGREEMENT WITH HUMAN RATERS (each model
    vs radiologists), not agreement BETWEEN models directly. No model-to-model agreement
    metric (e.g., kappa between GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 outputs) was reported. The comparison
    of model-vs-human kappas across models is a D4-level finding (which model agrees
    best with humans) rather than D3c internal structure evidence. D3c should be ''No
    evidence reported,'' which makes D3a=No since no other D3 sub-items have evidence.'

- item: D3a
  severity: major
  type: reclassify
  current_value: 'Yes'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: Consequent to D3c reclassification. The three-times-per-model repeated
    runs with majority answer are a QA procedure (D2e) rather than a formal reproducibility
    test (D3b) since no quantitative reproducibility metrics (ICC, kappa across runs)
    were reported. D3a should be No.

- item: D3b
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: No evidence reported
  recommended_value: 'Clarify: three repeated runs per model with majority answer
    selection described, but no quantitative reproducibility metrics reported. Correctly
    coded as No evidence per Rule #6 threshold.'
  rationale: 'The study ran each model three times and used majority vote, which is
    a QA procedure. However, no ICC, kappa, or percentage agreement across the three
    runs was reported, so this correctly does not meet the D3b threshold per Rule
    #6.'

- item: D3c_inter_model_agreement
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: Three LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Claude-3 Opus) were compared
    on the same 100-report set using quantitative performance against the same human
    references (kappa and accuracy; GPT-4o significantly outperformed alternatives
    in reported pairwise tests).
  recommended_value: 'Three LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Claude-3 Opus) were compared
    on the same 100-report set against the same human references (kappa and accuracy
    reported per model). GPT-4o showed highest kappa/accuracy across most criteria;
    pairwise model comparison was performed. Note: this is comparative model benchmarking
    against human reference rather than direct inter-model agreement testing.'
  rationale: The extraction correctly captures the data but could more clearly note
    that this is benchmarking against human ground truth rather than direct model-to-model
    agreement. The D3c coding is borderline per codebook and the uncertainty flag
    is appropriate.

    Temperature was set to 0 for deterministic output.
  rationale: The fulltext mentions temperature=0 setting which is a relevant QA detail
    for output determinism.

notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: One of the more complex extractions with multiple models and criteria. Well-handled
    overall.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The D3 reclassification is the primary issue. The repeated-runs procedure
    is better classified under D2e QA. D_summary will need updating.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Generally faithful extraction. The D3c coding is appropriately flagged as
    uncertain.
