issues:
- item: D2e_quality_assurance
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: Model-selection QA included repeated runs (three times per model
    with majority answer used) and independent dual-radiologist review for comparison.
  recommended_value: 'Model-selection QA included repeated runs (three times per model
    with majority answer used) and independent dual-radiologist review for comparison.
    Note: temperature setting not explicitly stated in fulltext body (only implied
    by API usage).'
  rationale: The R1 fidelity-reviewer recommended adding 'Temperature was set to 0
    for deterministic output' to D2e, but the v2 extraction's F3b notes disagreement
    with this recommendation, stating 'temperature was not stated in the provided
    full text.' After reviewing the fulltext, I find no explicit mention of temperature=0
    in the main text. The Methods section (line 73) describes using the GPT-4o API
    with model version 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06' and running 'three times' with majority
    vote, but does not specify temperature. The v2 extraction's decision to omit this
    detail is correct per source fidelity principles. This is a minor note, not a
    required change.

- item: F3b_items_for_verification
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Addressed issues: D3c (major reclassified to ''No evidence reported'');
    D3a (major changed to ''No''); D_summary updated for D3 consistency. Addressed
    minor issues: retained D2e as QA and retained D3b as ''No evidence reported''
    (codebook requires exact phrase for absent D-subitems). Disagreed with minor recommendation
    to add ''Temperature was set to 0'' to D2e because this was not stated in the
    provided full text. D3c rephrase minors were superseded by the major D3c reclassification.'
  recommended_value: No change needed
  rationale: 'The disagreement with the temperature=0 recommendation is verified correct:
    I searched the fulltext and found no mention of ''temperature'' or ''Temperature''.
    The extraction correctly declined this suggestion. Good source fidelity.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D3c correctly reclassified to 'No evidence reported' per R1 framework-reviewer
    recommendation. The v1 extraction coded three-model comparison as D3c, but as
    correctly identified, the Atsukawa study compared each model's agreement WITH
    human raters (kappa per model vs radiologists), not agreement BETWEEN models directly.
    No model-to-model kappa was reported. This is D4-level comparative evidence (which
    model best matches humans), not D3c internal structure evidence.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: 'D3a correctly changed to ''No'' following D3c reclassification. No other
    D3 sub-items have empirical evidence: the triple-run majority-vote procedure is
    correctly classified under D2e (QA) rather than D3b (reproducibility) since no
    quantitative test-retest metrics were reported per Rule #6.'
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D_summary updated appropriately to reflect D3 absence.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4 mapping remains thorough with criterion-level kappa and accuracy values
    for GPT-4o against both radiologists.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D4d temporal discrimination (first vs last term) correctly identified and
    quantified with P-values.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: D1 mapping (six predefined criteria, expert review of 100 reports) remains
    appropriate.

  text: F3b revision note accurately documents addressed issues and the temperature
    disagreement.

  text: 'Round 1 major issues addressed: D3c reclassified from inter-model agreement
    evidence to ''No evidence reported'' (correctly recognizing that model-vs-human
    benchmarking is D4 evidence, not D3c inter-model agreement). D3a changed from
    ''Yes'' to ''No''. D_summary updated accordingly.'
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: 'Round 1 minor issues addressed: D3b correctly retained as ''No evidence reported''
    (three-run majority-vote is QA, not formal reproducibility per Rule #6). Temperature=0
    detail correctly NOT added to D2e (confirmed that ''temperature'' does not appear
    in the provided fulltext). D3c minor rephrase superseded by major reclassification.'

notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All R1 major issues have been correctly addressed. The D3c-to-D4 reclassification
    was the critical change and has been well executed with consistent updates to
    D3a, D3b, and D_summary. The temperature detail disagreement is defensible based
    on source fidelity.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Excellent revision. All Round 1 issues cleanly resolved. The D3c reclassification
    and the correct decision to NOT add the temperature=0 claim demonstrate careful
    attention to source fidelity.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean extraction. All 8 approved finals are consistent with this file's structure
    and conventions.
