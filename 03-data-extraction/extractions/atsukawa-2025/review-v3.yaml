issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'CSV: ''Not defined in text (likely: Comma-Separated Values)'''
  recommended_value: (remove entry)
  rationale: CSV does not appear to be used in any YAML field value. May come from
    methods description in article but not from extraction content.
  source_passage: Scanned all field values
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'RQ3: ''Not defined in text (likely: Research Question 3)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: RQ3 appears in F2 value text. Defensible.
  source_passage: F2_rq3_relevance
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''artificial intelligence'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Artificial intelligence'''
  rationale: Cross-article consistency
  source_passage: Multiple fields
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'LLM: ''Large language model'''
  recommended_value: 'LLM: ''Large language model'''
  rationale: Already correctly capitalized. No change needed.
  source_passage: Multiple fields
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'CSV: Not defined in text (likely: Comma-Separated Values)'
  recommended_value: (remove CSV entirely or verify it appears in field values)
  rationale: 'Checking: CSV appears in the fulltext (line 73) but need to verify it
    appears in extraction field values. Scanning extraction: CSV does not appear in
    any field value. Should be removed per codebook rule.'
  source_passage: N/A - not in field values
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'API: Not defined in text (likely: Application Programming Interface)'
  recommended_value: 'API: Not defined in text (likely: Application Programming Interface)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''GPT-4o API'' (line 73) without spelling
    out API. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 73 of fulltext.md
