E1_limitations: '- Single-institution study; generalizability to other settings and 3-year programs may be limited.

  - Excluded additional affiliated training sites (about 30%-35% of ED training time) and off-service rotations.

  - Study period overlapped with COVID-19, which may have affected case mix/volumes.

  - NLP performance depends on completeness/quality of resident documentation, which may vary across individuals and time.

  '
E2_future_research: '- Apply the approach across multiple institutions to build a broader, data-driven map of emergency medicine practice and inform future MCPEM revisions.

  - Use exposure-gap detection for targeted educational interventions (for example, simulation for underexposed high-acuity/low-frequency topics).

  - Conduct future error analyses focused on retrieval scope and information-extraction phenomena (negation/temporality) in the NLP pipeline.

F1_key_findings_summary:
  summary: Retrieval-augmented NLP pipeline classified 244,255 ED encounters into 895 MCPEM topics, tracking resident clinical exposure from PGY1 (mean 376.7 topics) to PGY4 (565.9 topics), with 89.76% agreement with expert consensus.
  detail: 'In 62 emergency medicine residents, a retrieval-augmented generative AI pipeline mapped electronic health record documentation to 895 MCPEM topics across 244,255 encounters. Topic exposure rose from
    a mean of 376.7 topics in PGY1 to 565.9 in PGY4, with a 9.9% increase from PGY3 to PGY4, and substantial individual variability in plateau timing. Clinical workload and complexity also increased across
    training years (higher volumes, lower mean ESI, and more high-acuity cases). Manual validation showed 89.76% agreement of AI classifications with physician expert consensus.

    '
F2_rq3_relevance: 'This study highlights a scalable retrieval-augmented generation-based method for longitudinal workplace exposure tracking from clinical notes, but key methodological gaps remain for AI-in-workplace-based assessment
  evidence synthesis: no prompt transparency, no reproducibility testing across repeated runs/model versions, no inter-model agreement testing, and no subgroup bias/fairness (differential item functioning-equivalent)
  analysis. Consequential evidence is also missing (no learner impact or stakeholder acceptability data). These gaps are directly relevant to Downing-based validity mapping beyond simple AI-human agreement.

  '
F3_confidence:
  F3a_overall: 'Medium-High: most extraction items are explicitly reported; some validity mapping judgments (especially D4d and C1 framing as workplace-based assessment tool type) are interpretive.'
  F3b_items_for_verification: 'D1d: Expert review was used for classification accuracy; verify whether this should be weighted primarily under D4 rather than D1 in final synthesis.

    D4d: Known-groups/discriminant interpretation is not explicitly labeled by authors and may be coded differently across extractors.

    C1_wba_tools: Mapping this study to specific workplace-based assessment instrument categories is partly inferential because the source focuses on exposure tracking from documentation rather than a named
    standard workplace-based assessment form.

    Human verification (2026-02-18): D2c recoded from ''No evidence reported'' to ''Yes (indirect: false-positive analysis as proxy)'' per codebook Rule #8; 43/420 (10.24%) AI-expert disagreements constitute
    indirect false-positive evidence. D_summary updated to reflect D2 hallucination proxy. This aligns with coding applied to 7+ other studies in the corpus.
