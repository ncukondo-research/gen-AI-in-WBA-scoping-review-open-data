issues:
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: remove
  current_value: 'DIF: ''Not defined in text (likely: Differential item functioning)'''
  recommended_value: (remove or retain)
  rationale: DIF appears in F2_rq3_relevance value text ('DIF-equivalent'). Technically
    present in field values, so defensible.
  source_passage: F2_rq3_relevance
  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'AI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'''
  recommended_value: 'AI: ''Not defined in text (likely: Artificial intelligence)'''
  rationale: 'Cross-article consistency in capitalization. Also verify: the article
    likely does define AI somewhere; if so, the ''Not defined in text'' framing may
    be incorrect. However, this is a source-fidelity issue, not consistency.'
  source_passage: Multiple fields use 'AI'
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: add_missing
  current_value: (absent)
  recommended_value: 'WBA: ''Not defined in text (likely: Workplace-based assessment)'''
  rationale: WBA appears in F2 field value.
  source_passage: 'F2: ''AI-in-WBA evidence synthesis'''
  raised_by: consistency-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'AI: Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'
  recommended_value: 'AI: Not defined in text (likely: Artificial Intelligence)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: searching the fulltext, ''AI'' is not defined with explicit
    parenthetical expansion. The term appears but not with ''artificial intelligence
    (AI)'' inline. Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Throughout fulltext (no definition found)
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'EHR: Not defined in text (likely: Electronic health record)'
  recommended_value: 'EHR: Not defined in text (likely: Electronic health record)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: the fulltext uses ''electronic health records'' in the keywords
    (line 11) but does not explicitly define ''EHR'' with parenthetical expansion.
    Current coding is correct.'
  source_passage: Line 11 (keywords only)
  raised_by: fidelity-reviewer
- item: abbreviations
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: 'COVID-19: Not defined in text (likely: Coronavirus disease 2019)'
  recommended_value: 'COVID-19: Not defined in text (likely: Coronavirus disease 2019)'
  rationale: 'Confirmed: COVID-19 is used in the fulltext without explicit definition.
    As a universally recognized term, this is appropriate.'

commendations:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: All non-abbreviation fields identical to backup. No content changes.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Very comprehensive abbreviation list covering all relevant medical (ED, EM,
    ESI, PGY, MCPEM, SNOMED CT), technical (API, RAG, NLP, IR, IE), and regulatory
    (HIPAA, IRB) terms.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Excellent comprehensive coverage including domain-specific terms (MCPEM, SNOMED
    CT, ESI, EHR, IE, IR)
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Most abbreviations properly annotated with source-fidelity status
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer

- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Excellent comprehensive coverage of abbreviations including domain-specific
    ones (SNOMED CT, MCPEM, ESI, IE, IR).
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Correct definitions for ESI, HIPAA, MCPEM, SNOMED CT, ED, EM, IRB, PGY, API,
    NLP, RAG.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Appropriate identification of non-defined abbreviations (AI, DIF, EHR, QA,
    WBA).
notes:
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: Clean update. doi/published_year removed, abbreviation block added.
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Wait - WBA IS already listed. Let me recheck. Yes, WBA is listed on line 119.
    My error. Retracting the add_missing issue. This is a clean file.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: No major issues. Thorough and well-sourced abbreviation list.
