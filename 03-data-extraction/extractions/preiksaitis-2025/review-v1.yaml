- item: study_id

  current_value: Preiksaitis-2025
  recommended_value: Preiksaitis-2025
  rationale: Title case, consistent with most files. No change needed.

- item: B3a_prompt_reported
  severity: minor
  type: consistency
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: 'No'
  rationale: Correctly coded. This is one of the few studies where prompts were not
    reported at all. Consistent with codebook option.

  type: consistency
  current_value: 'Unclear: AI-derived exposure metrics differed by PGY level...'
  recommended_value: 'Unclear: AI-derived exposure metrics differed by PGY level...'
  rationale: Using 'Unclear:' is appropriate here since the study did not frame PGY
    differences as known-groups validity testing. Consistent with codebook guidance
    for ambiguous situations.

- item: D2c
  severity: minor
  type: missing_evidence
  current_value: No evidence reported
  recommended_value: 'Consider: the 89.76% agreement implies ~10% disagreement which
    per Rule #8 could be coded as indirect false-positive proxy'
  rationale: 'The study reports 89.76% agreement (377/420) between AI and expert consensus.
    The ~10% disagreement represents AI classifications not matching expert ground
    truth. Per Rule #8, false-positive rates may serve as indirect hallucination proxy.
    However, the 420 validated encounters represent only a validation subset, and
    the primary study does not frame the disagreements as errors or false positives
    per se. The coding as ''No evidence reported'' is conservative but defensible.
    For corpus-wide consistency, consider whether the same threshold applied to other
    studies (e.g., Kondo, Bala) should apply here.'

  raised_by: framework-reviewer
- item: D4d
  severity: minor
  type: clarification
  current_value: 'Unclear: AI-derived exposure metrics differed by PGY level...'
  recommended_value: Current coding is appropriate; the PGY-level differences reflect
    expected progression patterns but were not framed as known-groups validity testing
  rationale: The extraction correctly identifies this as Unclear rather than asserting
    discriminant ability. The study shows expected progression (increasing topics,
    complexity by PGY) but does not frame this as validation of the AI assessment
    tool itself.

- item: D4b_ai_human_agreement
  severity: minor
  type: correct_value
  current_value: AI classifications agreed with expert consensus 89.76% (377/420)
    in the manual validation sample.
  recommended_value: AI classifications agreed with expert consensus 89.76% (377/420)
    in the manual validation sample of 500 randomly selected encounters.
  rationale: Adding the total validation sample size (500 encounters) for context.
    The 377/420 denominator reflects that 80 of 500 encounters had no rater agreement
    or were excluded from the calculation (the fulltext states 420 as the denominator
    for the agreement calculation).

- item: B3a_prompt_reported
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'No'
  recommended_value: No (pipeline architecture described; specific prompts not provided;
    Multimedia Appendix 1 referenced for technical details)
  rationale: 'Minor: clarifying that while prompts are not reported in the main text,
    the appendix is referenced for pipeline details.'
  source_passage: 'Methods: ''A comprehensive description of the NLP architecture,
    model configuration, and validation methodology is provided in Multimedia Appendix
    1.'''

- item: D4d_discriminant_ability
  severity: minor
  type: rephrase
  current_value: 'Unclear: AI-derived exposure metrics differed by PGY level (e.g.,
    increasing topic coverage and acuity across training years), but the study did
    not explicitly frame this as known-groups validity testing of an assessment score.'
  recommended_value: 'Unclear: AI-derived exposure metrics showed expected progression
    by PGY level (e.g., increasing topic coverage PGY1 376.7 to PGY4 565.9; increasing
    acuity from ESI 2.94 to 2.79; high-acuity cases from 16% to 30.9%), but the study
    did not explicitly frame this as known-groups validity testing.'
  rationale: Adding the specific numbers strengthens the extraction and allows downstream
    synthesis.

notes:
- reviewer: consistency-reviewer
  text: Clean extraction. The RAG-based approach is unique in the set and correctly
    captured.
- reviewer: framework-reviewer
  text: The D2c consistency question is minor. Overall framework mapping is accurate
    and well-reasoned.
- reviewer: fidelity-reviewer
  text: Strong fidelity. All numbers verified. The interrater reliability kappa=0.71
    among physician reviewers is correctly omitted from D4b (it describes human-human,
    not AI-human, reliability) but could optionally be noted in D4c.
